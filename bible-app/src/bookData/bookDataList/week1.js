    content: `How do you think the world would look like without the book of Genesis that gives historical validity to the beginning of all things? The world would have been without any accurate record of the creations. The book of Genesis gives the historical accuracy to creation story. God in the book of Genesis proffered solution to the problem of the beginning of all things which science could not give a satisfactory answer. The book of Genesis remains the source. To modern readers, the book of Genesis might appear to be a strange book, beginning, as it does, with God and creation, and ending with Joseph in a coffin in Egypt (50:26)! Indeed, In the beginning, both serves its title, and is suggestive as to what the book is all about. In other words, it tells of the beginning of God's story, creation, human disobedience and divine redemption. It is also the first book of the Pentateuch, and serves as an introduction to the entire Bible, the story of God, choosing and making a covenant with a people through whom He would reach all people (12:2-3).
    The first Hebrew word used in the Book, Bereshith is also used as the title However, the English Bible uses the word "Genesis, which is the Greek translation of the Original Hebrew word. Genesis is a title that reflects what we find in the entire book, for it means "the origin, source or Creation." Obviously, the entire history took place before Moses birth. His role in werfting Genesis would be said to be mainly under the influence of the Holy Spirit to carefully fit together all the available written and oral accounts that we now have present in Genesis.`

These are thought-provoking questions which the mortal man cannot answer, be it scientists, philosophers or astrologers. 
    
    The only person who could really answer these questions for us is God Himself. Without the book of Genesis, our knowledge of a creating God would be pitifully limited and would be woefully ignorant of the beginning of our universe. Through Genesis, God is teaching us that He is the Creator and that He desires relationship with His people. People are special to God and unique. And above all, no matter the situation and no matter the depth of your sin, God loves and wants to use you in His plan. What was the cost in Eden, Genesis 3, is restored to us in Christ Jesus Romans 5:12. He alone is worthy for us to be an extension of His kingdom on earth.Just like the nation Israel was set apart to carry out God's purpose to the world, would you be faithful to carry out God's purpose on Earth?`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Exodus`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Exodus is the second book of the Bible. The name is a Latin word which means 'exit,"departure,"going,' or 'way out. The book, an integral part history-the exit from Egypt. It continues the narrative opened in Genesis and completed by the remaining books of the Law. Someone has said, "Exodus follows Genesis in much the same relation as the New Testament stands to the Old Testament."

    Exodus accounts for the early years of the Israelites, including their birth and earliest development as a nation divinely elected in accordance with God's eternal redemptive plan. In fact, it is predominantly the book of redemption in the Old Testament; and it conveys the design for deliverance/redemption.
    
    Both internal and external evidences support that the book was written
    under divine inspiration (2 Tim. 3:16) by Moses the servant of God, whe doubles as the great hero in the book (cf. Exod. 20:25; 24:4; 34:27; Jos 8:31 Mk. 7:10; 12:26; Lk. 2:22-23). He wrote to reveal God's love and purpose in redeeming an enslaved people from the bondage in Egypt, consecrating them into covenant that established them as His own people, and pitching His royal tent on earth, all through a human mediator.
    
    The book records the call and work of Moses, as a type of Jesus, our Suprem Mediator. It also describes how God instituted the priesthood, and delineates the functions of the prophet. It shows how God's ancien covenant relationship with His people graduated into the Mosaic covenant at Sinai. It reveals God's character of deliverance from Satan, sin and the world, by His character of progressive self-revelation climaxed in the Person of Jesus Christ. It shows that true worship should naturally follow redemption for the redeemed.

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Leviticus`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Leviticus is the 3rd book of the Bible, which was written in continuation of Exodus that narrates the journey of God's people from Egypt through the wilderness. In the wilderness, God commanded Moses to make a Tabernacle for Him, a place of worship, where the people would meet with Him (Exod. 25-31). Having obediently fulfilled the construction of the tent of meeting and the materials therein for holy service, God called on Moses to show him how to serve and worship Him (1:1-2), occasioning the emergence of the book of Leviticus.

    Leviticus was written by Moses, the leader of God's people, used by Him to lead Israel out of Egypt, with great miraculous signs. The book which was written in the wilderness, dates between 1450-1410 BC. The key characters are Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, Eleasar and Ithamar. The key verse is Leviticus 19:2b: You must be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy. The common themes are holiness, sacrifice and offering. However, holiness is mentioned more times (152) in this book than in any other book of the Bible.`

God specifies beginning from 1:1, describing the offerings and how to make them. 
      
    The sacrifices foreshadow Christ (Heb. 9:9). Chaps 8-10: Aaron and his sons were consecrated before they could do their priestly duties. God doesn't use any vessel that He hasn't first consecrated for His holy use.
    
    Aaron's sons who didn't keep to their consecration terms were divinely struck dead (10:1). Explain some of the things that can constitute strange fire on the altar, today. Chaps. 11-15: God is holy, and His people must be holy (cf. Matt. 5:48; 1 Pet. 1:14-16). He specifically warned them against defilement, to remain holy unto Him.
    
    16:6-17: Atonement is another strong theme in Leviticus. Despite the consecration of His people, God still set apart a day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) when they must atone for their sins, to remove the guilt of sin. Christ has perfected this, once and for all (Heb.9:23). 17:11ff describes the sanctity of blood. Compare this with Heb. 9:22 in the light of Gen. 3:21. What is the place of blood in Redemption?
    
    How can the believer achieve consecration and sanctification today when the blood of goats, rams and cattle are no longer of any effect, because of Christ's perfect sacrifice? It is only gentiles that still sacrifice (1 Cor. 10; 19:2) 18:1ff. God proscribed some sexual practices for His people. Never learn or join with the practices of the heathen. • 23:1ff: God permitted some feasts among His people: Sabbath, Passover, Unleavened bread, First fruits, Feast of Weeks, Trumpets, and Day of Atonement.

    Imagine God's own people wandering and reaching their destination very late, with many of them dying in the wilderness. While it is a fairly short distance from Egypt to Israel, it took the ancient Jews 40 years to get there. This happened because their disobedience and lack of faith caused God to make them wander in the desert until all the people of that generation had died, with a few important exceptions. The book draws its name from the census made of the people, a necessary step toward their organisation and future government. Numbers was written to the people of Israel to document their journey to the Promised Land, but it also reminds all future readers of the Bible that God is with us as we journey to heaven.

To show the imperativeness of stock-taking and accountability, God instructed Moses to take a census of the entire Israelites (1:1-2) and later the Levites (3:14) The most famous passage in Numbers is the Priestly Blessing in 6:24-26

    How significant is that to Christians today? Chaps. 11-21: A lack of an experiential knowledge of God usually brings disaster (cf. Dan. 11:32b). How did that affect Miriam, Aaron and the people themselves (Num. 10:11-14:45)? In Numbers 11, compare verses 1, 10, and 33. What made the Lord so angry? Do you think the same thing makes Him angry today? For 40 years, the people wandered in the desert until the faithless generation was consumed (15:1-21:35).

These events were written as examples for believers (1 Cor. 10:1-12). Sin and unbelief, especially rebellion, usually bring the judgement of God upon anyone (Heb. 3:7-4:13).

    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Though we are not expected to live in the past, yet, it will lead us to how we should live now and in the future. The book of Deuteronomy is a rehearsal or reinstatement of the laws proclaimed at Sinai, with a call to obedience on the part of the new generation. It was written by Moses (1:1; 4:44) about 1406 BC, as addresses delivered to the Israelites at the verge of entering Canaan, at the plains of Moab, to repeat and expound the law to them, so that they would not go the way of their fathers who died within the 40-year wilderness wandering, because of disobedience. Like Leviticus, Deuteronomy contains a vast amount of legal details, but its emphasis is on the laymen, rather than the priests. The Hebrew title of Deuteronomy is Haddebharim, "The words," taken from the opening phrase (1:1), These are the words. Deuteronomy is not a second law, as some claim, but an adaptation and expansion of much of the original Law given on Mount Sinai.

    The English title comes from the Greek title Deuteronomion, "the second law." Some of the notable themes are election, faithfulness, obedience and God s covenant of blessings for His people. The key verses are 18:15-19. The followings are some of the repeated words: all Israel (1:1; 27:9; 31:7...), people of Israel (5:1; 21:8; 32:8...), and children of Israel (1:3; 3:18; 4:45; 23:17...). This is a clear indication that Moses' messages were directed to the entire congregation of Israel. Everybody needs the Word for survival.`

    Expectation and Obligation. In this book, God wants us to know that as much as we expect Him to bless and protect us, we also owe Him obedience to the letter in fulfilling the covenant of election and blessing for our lives (30:19-20). Take Heed: This phrase is frequently repeated in Deuteronomy. It means to be careful and watch out in respect of the followings that would lead us to the fulfilment of God's purpose for our lives: 
    
    i. The giving of the law ((4:9,10)
    
    ii. The Covenant (4:23) iii. The past slavery (5:15)
    
    iv. The great deliverance (7:18) V. The divine leadership and supplies (8:2-6)
    
    vi. The sins of the past (9:7) vii. The divine judgement (24:9) viii. The ancient days (32:7) Commands to Follow: The Ten Commandments are meant for God's people to obey, to enjoy God's benevolence meant for them. The chief of these commands is love for the only One and True God (5:7). Promises: God's promises for His people are most times conditional; hinged on loyalty, obedience and faithfulness (chaps 27, 28). The Three Speeches of Moses hinge on 1. What God has done for Israel (1:1-4:43),
    
    2. What God expects from Israel (4:44-26:19), 3. What God will do for Israel (27:1-43:12).
    
    If you don't appreciate the past dealings of God, you may not value His present benevolence and thus lose His future blessings.
    
    • Contrasts: God is absolutely holy, while man is not. But man should strive to be holy. The righteous are blessed while the unrighteous are cursed (28:1-end). While God did not fail by truly loving Israel as His own people, Israel rejected God many times to have other gods.
    
    Errors to Avoid: The error of undue familiarity with divine things. God has no favourites when it comes to dealing with rebellion against His commands. Majority of the covenant people of Israel didn't get to the Promised Land, even the 'great Moses' himself (Num. 14:20-23; 20:12; Deut. 1:37; Heb. 4:6). What are those things that can deny you of Canaan here and ultimately?
    
    God will do what He will do. Do we have a part to play in actualising God's promises for our lives? 2 Why the need for repetition of God's Word to God's people? 
    
    3. Which portions of Deut. 28:1-68 do you prefer to read? Why?
    
    QUESTIONS:
    
    Deuteronomy is God's way of reminding us that despite His promises for us, we have own part to play in fulfilling His purposes for our lives-total obedience. To facilitate and generate this, we must keep repeating His Word to ourselves and to others. This would facilitate faith and obedience (Rom. 10:17). God chose to reemphasise all He had been telling His people in the wilderness for about 40 years. This underscores the fact that we must continually hear God's Word to remain ever fresh.`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Joshua`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The book of Joshua is the first of the historical books in the English Bible; the first of the Former Prophets (including Judges, the books of Samuel and the books of Kings) in the Hebrew Bible. It begins with YAHWEH'S commission of Joshua (1:1-9) and concludes with the burial of Joshua, Eleazar and the bones of Joseph (24:29-33). It shows how Joshua continued in the footsteps of Moses to divide the Promised Land among God's people, Israel, and how Israel began prospering in the land.

    Tradition agrees that Joshua wrote the book (cf. 24:26). The name 'Joshua' is sometimes spelt "Jehoshua," "Jehoshuah" (1 Chro. 7:27), or "Jeshua" (Neh. 8:17). He is alternately called Jeshua in Ezra-Nehemiah. There are other Joshuas in the Bible (1 Sam. 6:14,18; 2 Kgs. 23:8; Hag. 1:1-14;Zech.3:1-9;Lk. 3:29). The author of the book of Joshua is the son of Nun who was Moses assistant and successor (Exod. 17:8-15). We are talking of the military leader whom God chose to lead the Israelites in the conquest of Canaan (Num, 13:16). By the time of the conquest of the Promised Land, he was an old man (Josh. 19:49-50; 23; 24:15), and he died at the ripe age of 110. He was buried in the land of his inheritance at Timnath-serah (24:29-30).`

    content: `Joshua is a very important figure in the book named after him. How did he become so prominent (1:1-9)?

    Identify the different Joshuas in 1 Sam. 6:14,18; 2 Kgs. 23:8; Hag. 1:1-14; Zech. 3:1-9; and Lk. 3:29. Compare them with the son of Nun (Exod. 17:3 15; Num. 13:16).
    
    One thing characteristic of Joshua's lifetime is that Israel served the LORD during his days (24:31; Jdg. 2:7). How do you think Joshua achieved this? What are you doing to disciple people around you and the next generation?
    
    God gave Moses a staff, but gave Joshua the Word. What are the implications of God's injunction to Joshua in 1:6-8 for us today? Going through the book of Joshua, we see that Joshua followed God's leading: he took up the challenge; sent spies and led the people across the Jordan into the promised land of Canaan. Do you see that as the secret of Joshua's success? How obedient are you to the Lord's directives in the assignments He gives you?
    
    Draw lessons from the faithfulness of Rehab the harlot (2:1-12). What gave the people of God victory in battle of Jericho (6:1-27)?
    
    Read 7:1ff; Draw out lessons from Achan's disobedience, God's judgement, and Joshua's attitude to these. Does God still deal likewise, today?
    
    Don't have the notion that you can handle things yourself or thinking it is only when you are in an unpleasant situation that you can turn to God for help and guidance. There is danger in overconfidence (7:1-13). Only the confidence we have in God produces victory and unquantifiable success.
    
    . What can we learn from Joshua's mistake in entering into treaty with the Gibeonites without God's consent, and his attitude when he discovered the mistake thereafter (9:1-27; cf. 2 Sam. 21:1ff)? What do you know about Caleb the warrior? What was his relationship with Joshua (13:6,30; 14:16-14)? • It is glaring from Joshua that our God is the ultimate promise Keeper who keeps His promises and covenants right from generation to generation (cf. Num. 23:19).
    
    . As long as we abide by and follow God's commands, we are sure of experiencing divinely orchestrated victory and blessings (cf. Deut.
    
    28:1ff). Just as Joshua watched Moses and learnt from him, someone is also watching and learning from you. People believe and love to learn from your lifestyle than what you teach or say. So, watch your life and doctrine lest you mislead others (cf. 1 Tim. 4:16).`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Judges`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Judges is the OT book named after the prominent leaders raised by the LORD to deliver His people from their oppressors. The Heb. word for "judge" denotes the activity of governance, including warfare. A judge may be a charismatic deliverer or a local judicial sage. It is uncertain why in the Bible, some judges receive cursory attention, whereas the exploits of other judges are given in detail. In any case, the book of Judges analyses the life of Israelites in Canaan after the death of Joshua and before the LORD had given them kings. It is a heart-breaking exact account of how YAHWEH (God) was taken for granted by His children (the Israelites), time after time, period after period. The book of Judges becomes a sad divergence from the book of Joshua which records the blessings God conferred on the Israelites for their obedience in conquering the land.

    The Book is dominated by a cycle of apostasy on the part of God's people divine judgement, the people's cry for deliverance, and God's raising up of a judge to deliver them. Honestly, this repetitiveness suggests the fact that Israel remains unchanged by God's grace. The book was written to demonstrate the meaninglessness of this stage in Israel's development, explain why the tribes didn't occupy all the land promised to the patriarchs, justify the way of the gracious and patient God, compared with Israel's repeated disobedience, and explain the urgent need for a new momentum, lest Israel succumb to the Philistines and intertribal warfare.`

    content: `God promises Israel prosperity (Exod. 3:8; 23:30; Num. 13:27; 34:1-12; Deut. 8:6-9). God had perfectly, provisionally given the land into their hands, but that came with conditions. God's promises never fail (Num. 23:19), yet He requires that we trust and obey Him, as much as we worship Him, for the promises to be fulfilled (Deut. 7:12-15).

    They were to destroy the original dwellers in the land (Deut. 7:1-5), but they failed, hence the serious divine verdict against them (Jdg. 2:2-3), leading to their numerous defeats. Failing to remove temptation of the Canaanites, they soon began serving their gods (2:11-13; 10:6). When God commands, EVERYONE must obey.
    
    The abominable sins the people committed include: 
    1. Evil in General (4:11; 6:1; 13:1)-Prostitution (11:1; 16:1-3); Theft
    
    (17:1,2); Homosexuality (19:22); Gang Rape (19:23-30; 20:5); and Civil War (20:1ff) 
    
    2. Failures to destroy all enemies (1:21,27-36; 2:1-3)
    
    3. Idolatry (2:11-13,17,19; 3:7,12; 6:10,25; 8:33; 10:6; 17:4-5; 18:14 21,30-31)
    
    4. Inter-marriage (3:5-6; 14:1-3)
    
    5. Murder (9:5,24,45; 18:27; 19:27-30; 20:5)
    
    How did it happen? How did things get that worse? (cf. Jdg. 2:10; 7:4). Disobedience was the major error here, that God wanted us to avoid; it brought judgement. The Israelites plunged into disobedience, the more God's wrath fell on them, because the Lord disciplines those he loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son (Heb. 12:6).
    
    God will not allow sin to go unpunished (Deut. 7:10), hence the way He disciplined them in Judges, for following other gods, in defiance of Him. He hasn't changed (Heb. 13:8).
    
    • Judges shows a gracious demonstration of God's faithfulness in spite of Israel's unfaithfulness. He punished them when they sinned. Yet, He listened to their cries for mercy and raised judges to deliver them:
    
    1. Othniel (3:7-11)
    
    2. Ehud (3:12-30)
    
    3. Shamgar (3:31) 4. Deborah and Barak (4:1-5:31)
    
    5. Gideon (6:1-8:35)
    
    6. Tola (10:1-2)
    
    7. Jair (10:3-5)
    
    8. Jephthah (10:6-12:7)
    
    9. Ibzan (12:8-10)
    
    10. Elon (12:11)
    
    11. Abdon (12:13-15) 12. Samson (13:1-16:31)
    
    Judges reveals Grace in God's compassionate delivery of His people, despite their sin and rejection of Him, and this presents a picture of Christ on the cross, dying to redeem and deliver His people-all who would ever believe in Him-from their sin (Matt. 1:21).`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Ruth`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The book of Ruth took its name from the woman who is the leading character in the book, which is best described as a story. It is one of the historical book, and gives an account of an incident that took place during the time of the Judges in Israel (1:1). It is the story of a Moabitess woman who forsook her pagan heritage to cling to YAHWEH, the God of Israel. It equally emphasises the result and reward of loyalty, both to God and man, as Ruth was handsomely rewarded for her decision to follow her mother-in law and the mother-in-law's God, unwaveringly. 
    
    God moved throughout this book as the divine Director and chief Administrator of events, orchestrating a plan to graft the young Ruth into the family tree of David, and leading ultimately to Jesus. It is evident in the book that God accomplishes His work and plan through all the joys and tragedies of life; famine, loneliness, death, voluntary exile, and unshaking fidelity. All these become the tools God uses to fulfil His sovereign plan- immediate and eternal restoration. The author of the book is unknown. The book may be considered as a justification for including the godly Moabitess in the nation of Israel.`

    content: `The book of Ruth traces the lineage of Ruth to David. Compare Matthew 1:1-5 and Ruth 4:17-22 to see how that fulfils the Davidic ancestry of Jesus Christ. That a foreigner, even a Moabitess, can be linked with Israel's blessing is an attestation to the beauty of God's grace. (Mt 1:5; Ruth 4:17-22).
      
    In the book of Ruth, God is showing to the entire world a sample of His eternal restoration and redemptive plan for mankind (4:9-10). The book also talks about what man's response to God's redemptive plan should be -loyalty and alignment (1:8-17). Ruth was a Moabitess, but how else would she have come to Bethlehem to fulfil God's eternal purpose, if God had not caused a severe famine in Bethlehem, which eventually led Elimelech and his entire family to seek greener pasture in the land of Moab. God was orchestrating a route for Ruth's involvement in His eternal plan (1:1-2).
    
    1:16-17: In a beautifully and emotionally charged poetic response, Ruth described her determination to remain with Naomi. Her assertion that Naomi's God would be her God is exceptionally striking. Ruth's use of the divine name, YAHWEH, in an Oath indicates her commitment to the living God. She was choosing to cling not only to Naomi, her land, and her people, but also to her God. Ruth forsook all to follow the one true God. The decision to follow Jesus must be made and faithfully adhered to (Mk.8:34ff). The love that Ruth showed to Naomi (4:15) provides a pattern of devotion.
    
    2:1: Very significantly, the book of Ruth presents the concept of kinsman-redeemer as a type of Messiah. He must be a blood relative, can purchase, be willing to buy the inheritance, and be willing to marry the widow of the deceased kinsman. A'l these God provisionally and perfectly did for us in Christ Jesus.
    
    . God is behind the scene in this story. He leads Ruth to the farm of Boaz, a worthy kinsman-redeemer. Any implication from the meaning of Boaz, swift strength"? What does the law say about gleaning (Lev. 23:22)?
    
    Jesus in Ruth. His redemptive power and move are clearly prefigured in Boaz's acceptance to restore these shattered women (3:1-18). Christ is our only hope of glory. No one comes to Him and is cast out (Jn. 6:37). In Ruth, we see God working towards the fulfilment of His eternal redemptive programme fully achieved in Christ Jesus, the Messiah.
    
    4:1ff. Boaz rose to the occasion when the close relative failed to fulfil his responsibility for Ruth. This typifies how Jesus, against all odds, sacrificially redeemed us with His blood, despite that we are undeserving.
    
    QUESTIONS
    
    1. Ruth made a great decision that positively impacted on her future, even in her hopelessness. Any lesson for us today?
    
    2. Show that Boaz is a type of Christ by how he fulfilled his responsibility over the redemption of Ruth.`,

However, the birth and righteous living of a man, called Samuel, changed everything. He was able to reconcile Israel to God through his connection with God, his holy judgeship, priesthood and prophethood. As time went on, Israel kicked against God's kingship through the judges and priests. Samuel was not happy with that, but God went ahead to grant Israel their desire-permissive divine will. They later rejected it anyway, and the king (Saul) was removed.

    The books of Samuel reveal the sovereignty of God in human government; His power to add, subtract, divide, multiply and substitute. The main message of the books is the Lord's sovereignty and faithfulness towards His people, even when they fail. And that leads to the promise of the Messiah. At the end of the books, both houses of Saul and David bad crashed. Why? Their failure to follow YAHWEH completely. Yet, God remains faithful to His promises. The books emphasise the Holy Spirit as the Spirit who empowers, and God, as One who justifies.`

Does God still do that today (Psa. 75:6)?
    
    Saul moved from humility to pride; stewardship to oppression, and ultimately, to murder, and eventually wasted himself and his throne. 2 Sam. 7-24: David moved from farm to palace, from palace to wilderness and back to palace.

It is okay as spiritual Israelites to ask our Father for anything, but we must be truthfully ready to subject it to His approval, in order to prevent any loss.

    content: `The 2 books of Kings, like the 2 books of Samuel, were originally one in the Hebrew Bible. The title came from 1 Kgs. 1:1-Heb. Melechim, "Kings." The division into 2 separate books was done in the Septuagint. Therefore, they are better overviewed together.

    The books tell the story of Israel's monarchs beginning with David in his old age, and how the baton fell on Solomon to continue where his father stopped. It gives the account of Solomon's initial love for God that occasioned his unequalled achievements and prosperity, most especially, the unparalleled glamour of the temple in Jerusalem. But sadly, he began apostatising, thus resulting in the breaking of the kingdom of Israel into the North and the South. The books reveal the lives of both the kings of Israel (North) and Judah (South) in relation to how they fared in their relationship with God. For instance, Jeroboam was privileged to be installed in the Nons as God said. Yet, he fumbled. The trend continued. Majority of the norther kings followed Jeroboam's had example, as well as some of the kings of Juda
    
    The books also reveal how God sent His messengers (prophets) to deal with the situations in the leadership of both the united and divided kingdomsf Israel. This serves as a serious caution to us today to follow God with s perfect heart, just like king David who became God's yardstick for all e Israel's monarchs after him. The books show a contrast of the lives of those who lived for God and those who refuse to do so through the history of the kings of Israel and Judah.`

How is that happening today?
    
    12:1-14:20: None of the kings of Israel got to the throne without the knowledge or approval of God. Yet, not all of them followed His ways and leading (9:2,3; cf. 1 Sam. 9:27-10:1; 16:13; 2 Sam. 2:4; 5:3). Leaders: Bewarned.
    
    Read 1 Kgs. 14:8; 15:3ff; 16:2, 19; 22:52; 2 Kgs. 3:3; 14:3; 16:2. Both David and Jeroboam became points of reference in Israel. How did God rate and judge them and their legacies? Way of Jeroboam: This phrase cuts across the books of kings and it describes the terrible reign of Jeroboam characterised by pervasion, idolatry and all forms of godlessness. Many kings followed his evil legacy (1 Kgs 15:26,34; 16:2,19,26,31-34; 2 Kgs 8:27; 9:9; 10:29; 13:6,11; 14:24; 15:9,18,24, 28; 16:3).

    2 Kgs. 17:1ff: Due to the godless and recalcitrant leadership of some of the Israel's kings, the northern kingdom was divinely sold off to exile. Because Judah also didn't learn from their sister's woe, they also were eventually exiled. The damage of sin is better imagined than experienced. How can we avert such a nasty experience today as God's own people? The events that made Samaria the state of the corrupted perverted Jews need to be taken seriously (Mt 10:4; John 4:4; Acts 1:8)`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Chronicles`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The books of Chronicles were originally a book in the Hebrew Bible. The Hebrew title means "The Words (or Events) of the Days," hence "The Annals". The Greek Title is paraleipomenwn A, B [The Books] of Things Left Out, and it posits the fact that Chronicles supplement the history in the books of Samuel and Kings in many places. That is misleading, anyway. Why? Chronicles also repeats many of the materials in Samuel and Kings Don't confuse the references to the "Chronicles" mentioned in the books of Kings with the book of Chronicles. Both Kings and Chronicles drew from earlier court chronicles. It is like that the court scribes then produced a number of scrolls recording the daily events of each monarch's rule (Est. 2:23;6:1; 10:2).

    The Chronicles could be dated to be between 520 and 400 B.C. The author is unknown; however, many refer to the unknown author as "the chronicler". Many events contained in the first and second Kings were relayed in the books of the Chronicles from a different perspective. The book of Chronicles was written during the post-exilic period for the people of Judah who returned from exile to provide encouragement and exhortation for the returnees. Emphasis was placed on obedience to God, the successes of the kings that obeyed, and the failures of the disobedient kings, and also idolatry and infidelity were outrightly condemned. May God help us as we journey briefly through the books of the Chronicles.`

    content: `God has been at the forefront of the history of mankind, especially, the Israelites. The opening of the Chronicles starts with the genealogy from Adam downwards (1 Chro. 1:1ff).

    The sovereignty of God is highlighted in Chronicles-His greatness, power and uniqueness are plainly expressed (1 Chron. 16:25-26; 17:20; 29:11-12;2 Chron. 6:14; cf. Psa 96:4-5).
    
    The Lord fights the battles of His people (1 Chron. 10:13-14; 18:6; 2 Chron. 12:2; 13:15; 20:15; 21:11-14; 24:18; 28:1,5-6,19). The more we remain in Christ, the greater victory we experience, that we might express His glory (1 Cor. 15:57).
    
    David's commendable passion for the worship and service of the Lord evident in the brining of the Ark of The Covenant to Jerusalem was passionate about the proper worship of God. David devoted himself to YAHWEH'S worship, and organised the temple service involving the priests and Levites (1 Chron. 15; 23-24; 16:7-36). What can be said about your attitude to God, His worship and service.
    
    Describe the covenant God made with David because of his zeal for God and His things (1 Chron. 17:1-27;29:1-9; 2 Chron. 13:5; 21:7;23:3).
    
    One of the themes in Chronicles is seeking God wholeheartedly (1 Chron. 16:10-11; 22:19; 28:8; 2 Chron. 11:16; 14:4; 15:2,12-13). What did David charge Solomon to willingly do (1 Chron. 28:9)?
    
    Chronicles conspicuously account for how Solomon glamorously built and dedicated the golden edifice called Temple.
    
    . It is a grievous thing to neglect God. From the following scriptures, highlight some of the consequences of forsaking God (1 Chron. 10:1-14; 2 Chron. 13:1-16; 16:12; 18:33-34; 20:12; 21:15-19; 24:20; 25:14-24; 26:19-20; 28:1-5; 33:1-11). What of those who seek Him well (2 Chron. 12:14, 16:12, 20:1-30, 30:1-27, 31:20-21)? God is seeking for true worshippers (II Chro. 16:9 Jhn. 4:21-24) Jesus is prefigured in Chronicles as the One coming to fully and ultimately establish the throne of David forever (Matt. 1:1-17, Luke 3:23-38).

    content: `The Chronicles can be said to be Israel's spiritual heritage. It serves as a reminder, encouragement, and hope for a better future for the exile returnees, and to as many who would believe in God. God is always faithful to His promise and He is a covenant-keeping God. He fulfilled His promise to David in the person of Jesus Christ, our Lord and saviour, whose reign has no end. God's glory filled the temple that the priests could not enter. 
    This is an indication that, if we dedicate our lives unto God, He will fill our lives with His presence. For our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19), which is not built with hands, as the Father is looking for true worshippers who would worship Him in spirit and truth (Jn. 4:23-24). There is the hope of restoration, if we humble ourselves, pray, seek God and turn from our wicked ways. It pays to seek, know and serve Him than to neglect/reject Him.`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Ezra-Nehemiah`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Like sesame twins, the books of Ezra and Nehemiah were originally one book in the Hebrew manuscript. Even, possibly, Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah were a first and second volume of Hebrew history. God's people had fulfilled their years in the Babylonian exile and needed to come home according His plan for them (cf. Jer. 29:1ff). But their home, Jerusalem, had been chattered, and needed re-building. There were three men whose efforts were germane to the resettlement of God's people in their God-given Land, Jerusalem: Ezra, Nehemiah and Zerubbabel. Ezra 7:1 affirms that Ezra arrived in Jerusalem during the reign of Artaxerxes the king of Persia, precisely in the 5th month of the 7th year of the king (v. 8). Neh. 8:2 identifies Ezra as Nehemiah's contemporary. Neh. 1:2; 2:1 affirm that the events of Nehemiah occurred in the 20th year of king Artaxerxes. Thus, the first time Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem was between 12 and 13 years after Ezra's arrival. Neh. 13:6-7 may imply that Nehemiah left Jerusalem in the 32nd year of Artaxerxes, and returned later.

    There are two major themes that run through Ezra Nehemiah. First is Calling that consists in God, calling, commissioning and using nationals and foreigners for His purposes. And, Revival which has to do with God, raising men and women among His people to revive them in all endeavours. The key verses bringing the two books together are Ezra 1:1:7:28: Nehemiah 2:8-9,`

    content: `As Ezra-Nehemiah set out to provide a record of the reconstruction of the Hebrew theocracy upon the physical and spiritual foundations of the past, and emphasise covenant renewal in the restored community (cf. Neh. 8-10), the key messages are the power of God's Word in human life, and the building of the walls as a type of building the Divine Kingdom on Earth (Ezr. 1:1;9:4). God's superintendence shows that God will fulfil His promises to restore His people, however broken down they appear; He uses anybody whoever he/she is-Cyrus, Darius, Artarxerxes, Ezra, Nehemiah, Zerubbabel, etc. Conviction. The people wept because they were convicted by divine messages that aroused their conscience for a change. The messages were to reconstruct their Jewish life and be de-robed of all foreign attire (Ezr.9:2). Exogamy (marrying outside their people's own social group) was, and remains a sin among God's people. Intermarriage with non-lewish or foreigner was a sin which they restituted (Ezr. 10:2,3) .
    
    The acts of Ezra. He found a copy of the law, read it to the people, and revival ensued (Ezr. 7:10ff). The impact of God's word in reshaping our lives cannot be over-emphasised.
    
    The acts of Nehemiah. He, assisted by the king, led his people to rebuild the fallen Jerusalem walls (Neh. 2:17ff). He also instituted moral and religious reforms to re-dedicate the Jews to God (Ezr. 10:1-3, 18, 19), Is there anything that needs rebuilding in your life?
    
    Though, the project faced stiff opposition, God's work cannot be stopped. The project was completed (Neh. 12:27ff). We are called to build lives for Christ, and not to destroy them.
    
    The acts of Zerubbabel. He was to rebuild the fallen Jerusalem Temple, with its altar (Ezr. 4:1-6,24). God used Darius to order the completion (Ezr. 6:14-18). God uses anyone for His purpose, even the unbelievers. As the temple of the Lord (1 Cor. 6:19), hope your altar is still standing and functioning?
    
    • The institution of the temple, installation of its officers, and the emphasis of the Law portray the historical and theological continuity between the pre-exilic and postexilic Israel. It proclaims the legitimacy of the restored community's religious, political, economic, and social life as God's people (cf. Neh. 9:32-37). Contrast in the books: While Cyrus, Darius and Artarxerxes were instruments in God's hands for these projects, the likes of Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem were devil's agents to stop them. Where do you stand?
    
    Jesus in Ezra-Nehemiah: The Lord of heaven and earth (Ezr. 1:2), the covenant-keeping God (Neh. 1:5). Who is Jesus in your family, work, business, etc.? There is no competition and individualism in God's business. Remember Zerubbabel, Ezra and Nehemiah. Each was called by God for different assignments amongst the SAME PEOPLE.

    
    QUESTIONS

      content: `For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this? (Esther 4:14)`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Esther`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Esther was the queen of Ahasuerus, and heroine of the book that bears her name. She was a Jewess, named Hadas'sah ('the myrtle'), but when she entered the royal harem, she received the name by which she henceforth became known (Est. 2:7). She was the foster daughter of her cousin, Mordecai, who held some office in the household of the Persian king. Ahasuerus, having divorced the misfiring Vashti, chose Esther as wife.
    
    The Book of Esther does not specifically name its author. And it was likely written between 460 and 350 B.C. The book of Esther tells how a Jewish girl became the queen of Persia and saved her people from a plot to destroy them. She is assisted in this by Mordecai, her cousin and guardian. Esther is part of a much larger story that runs all the way from Abraham to Christ and through her to the church. If Haman had succeeded, the Jewish people as a whole would have been destroyed, and the story of God's saving work, in and through Abraham's descendants would have come to an end. There would have been no fulfilment in Christ, and therefore, no gospel and no Christian church. Christians should read the book of-Esther, not just as a story about the Jews but as part of their heritage. Christians are not obliged to observe the Feast of Purim, but they are to take to heart the truth that God providentially watches over His own (Rom. 8:28).
    
    The theme of the Book is divine providence in human responsibility and the absurdity of wickedness, and this conveys the idea that though, the name of God is not mentioned in the book, but His existence and works were experienced. The Book purposefully records the institution of the Feast of Purim and the obligation of its perpetual observation. Characteristically, the book of Esther is one of only two books in the OT that is named for a woman. The Book has since become what is read at the Feast of Purim to commemorate the great deliverance of the Jewish nation brought about by God through Esther (3:7;9:26-32).`

    content: `The book of Esther contains no direct reference to God, though His hand is seen throughout the book, as the book infers a providential destiny (4:13-16) and speaks of fasting for deliverance. Even though God's name is not directly mentioned, it is evident that His presence is present throughout the story, and His people are aware of this.

    Esther's wisdom, grace and humility allowed her to place the fate of her people far above herself- even if it caused her life, contrary to Haman's pride that blinded him to the truth that Mordecai deserved honour far above himself.
    
    The book points to Jesus. Jesus is revealed in the book in very specific ways. Esther had lost her parents; she came from a place of family deficiency, yet called to a place of royalty.... Jesus takes us in, so God becomes the Father to the fatherless. Esther put her position of royalty on the line to save Israel.
    
    • Queen Esther acted courageously when she made the decision to gather the Jews, fast and approach the king. She also courageously planned the feasts and timely made her requests, eventually begging King Ahasuerus to save the Jews. We must be courageous in the Lord (Jos. 1:18; 2 Chro. 15:7; 2 Tim. 1:7; cf. Rev. 21:8). Having a positive mindset that is backed by courage and perseverance, will we provide a platform for greater things to happen.
    • Haman's anger against Mordecai, and by extension the entire Jews is a demonstration of the passionate hatred of the devil and his hosts against the Gospel (3:1-6). But He has always failed (cf. Rom. 16:20). God places mentors in our lives to teach wisdom. Mordecai proved to be a wonderful God-sent mentor and parent to Esther.
    
    It is evident from the book that God is the only One who turns trials to blessings (4:14). Our prayers and voice matter to Him, and He answers accordingly, God is able to bring great favour and blessing on our ways, even in hard situation (5:1-3). How does King Ahasuerus's wrath against Haman teach us about w rath against our sin (In. 3:18; Rom. 1:8; 5:8-10)? When Mordecai heard the edict, he tore his clothes and clothed himsel in sackcloth and ashes. What's your response to seeing injustice and evil around you? What can Mordecai's response to injustice and evil teach us about our own? God`

    The lively story of the reversal of fortunes of the Jewish people in exile shows us the mighty acts of God. The triumph of Mordecai, the underdog, and the role played by Esther the queen, have seriously called for emulation among God's people. God might seem silent in any situation. That doesn't change the fact of His powerful presence that brings everything good and godly, including deliverance and all other good things.`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Job`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The book of Job is the first of five books commonly referred to as "The Books of Poetry" (Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Song of Solomon)- written in poetic style in contrast to the narrative style of most other books; also often referred to as "Wisdom Literature". It tells the story of a man, Job (Iyyob Hebrew, lob Greek) who lost all that he had, including his children, wealth and health. The book opens with a heavenly debate between God and Satan, and closes with the manifold restoration of fortunes to Job. 
    
    When good people suffer, the human spirit struggles to understand. Throughout recorded history, people have asked: How can this be? If God is almighty and "holds the whole world in His hands," and if He is truly good, how can He allow such an outrage? Job struggled to know why God would allow such a terrible occurrence in his life. The book records events that probably occurred during the time of the patriarchs (sometime between Noah and Moses) The story of Job is one of the books written for our learning, to provide patience, comfort and hope (Rom. 15:4). James refers to Job when seeking to fetch patience (cf. Jas. 5:10-11) Job presents a valuable lesson in His Distress (1-3), Defence (4-37), and Deliverance (38-42). So, Christians should certainly take the time to study it`

    content: `It is most probable that Job lived during the time of the patriarchs. Note that the book doesn't mention the Law of Moses like it referred to a flood (22:16). Also, in the manner of Abraham (Gen 12:7), Job functions as a priest in offering sacrifices for his family (1:5). Added to the fact that Job's longevity is typical of the patriarchs (42:16; cf. Gen 11:22-26,32). Rather than answer the age-long question, "Why does God allow the righteous to suffer?" that Job himself never received a direct answer, the book answers the question, "How should the righteous suffer?" Though he is never told of Satan's challenge, "'Does Job fear God for nothing? God allowed job to suffer in answer to that challenge. Read Jas. 5:11. The book paints a beautiful picture of "patience" which means to maintain fidelity to God, even under great trials, whether we understand what is happening, or not. The book shows us how the righteous should bear up under suffering. Job came close to charging God with wrong, yet he never crossed the line, but humbly submitted to God when told that the answers to his questions are beyond his ability to understand.
    
    The book defends God's absolute glory and perfection (cf. Psa. 18:3). We must praise God for who He is, apart from the blessings He bestows. Satan denied this (1:9-11), but Job proved him wrong (1:20-22;2:10). Though we can't tie all the "loose ends" of the Lord's purposes together because His workings are beyond man's ability to fathom (cf. Psa. 115:3),
    
    we must learn to trust in Him, no matter the conditions. God shows in the book that suffering isn't always the result of personal sin, but may be allowed as a compliment to one's spirituality, to silence Job's friends erroneous conclusion. God allowed Job to suffer to prove to Satan what kind of man he really is. Does God have such confidence in You?
    
    • The book also prefigures the coming of Christ: ✓9:33; 33:23; cf. 1 Tim. 2:5 ✓19:25; cf. Eph. 1:7`

Those who love God are not exempted from troubles (In. 16:33; Phil. 1:29; 2 Tim. 3:12; 1 Pet. 5:8-10). Although, we may not be able to understand fully the pain we experience, it can help us to rediscover God. It is unlikely that any of us will ever be called upon to suffer as Job did. 
    
    However, when we do suffer, let us remember that job is our great example: (1 Pet. 4:16) he had to face his struggles with the answers, reasons and explanations held back. If we pass the test as well as Job did, we will hear the Master say, "Well done, good and faithful servant...enter into the joy of your Lord."`

In this regard, the book of Psalms is very relevant. In fact, it is the Longest OT book quoted most frequently in the NT, and has occupied a central place among God's people over the years. It was originally titled, in Hebrew, Tehillim ("praise songs"). The English title, "Psalms" was from the Septuagint's title, Psalmoi-songs of praise sung to stringed instruments.

    Several of the Psalms identify their authors. David wrote about 73 Psalms reg. 2,95,96,105,106); Moses wrote Psalms 90, the Levitical clan; Asaph wrote 12 (50,73-83), the Sons of Korah, 10 (42, 44-49, 84, 87, & 88), Solomon wrote Psalms 72,127; Ethan the Ezrahite wrote Psalms 89, while the rest 51 are anonymous.

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Proverbs And Ecclesiastics`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The books of Proverbs and Ecclesiastics are two uncommon books in Hebrew wisdom literature that teach that godliness is practical, and that God's wisdom is the key to be godly and successful in life. Every relationship in life is mentioned in the Books. Therein, we find our duty to God, to our neighbours, the duty of parents and children, and other obligations as citizens. Proverbs and Ecclesiastics are designated as wisdom literatures. In a similar way, ancient Israel had three categories of ministers; the Priests, the Prophets and the Wise men. The sages or wise men were specially gifted with godly wisdom and counsel concerning both practical and philosophical issues of life. Proverbs represents the God-inspired wisdom of these individuals.

    The book of proverbs contains the essence of wisdom, based upon the fear of God. It points out what is wrong in God's sight as regards man's conduct. The basic truth constantly affirmed in Proverbs is expressed in the statement, The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge (1:7; cf. 15:33). Ecclesiastics, on itself, is a book of experiment that investigates life and tells us what kind of life is worth living. In the book, God has given the record of all that human thinking and natural religion has not been able to discover concerning the meaning and goal of life. It is better regarded as the quest of a soul who sees only vanity all about him, until his eyes are opened to the help offered by God.`

    content: `The book of Proverbs can be broadly divided into three: 
    1. Counsel for young men (chaps. 1-9);
    2. Counsel for all men (chaps. 10-20); and 
    3. Counsel for kings and rulers (chaps. 21-31).
    
    Wisdom, to God, is not about great cleverness, but about what (1:7)? 
    What does Eccl. 1:1 call the writer of the book of Ecclesiastes (cf. 1:12; 7:27:12:8-10)?
    
    Solomon wrote Ecclesiastes during the last years of his life, having searched for happiness in power, wealth, wisdom, honour, fame, and sensual pleasure, all to no avail-vanity of vanities all is vanity (cf. 11:9 10; 12:1,13-14).
    
    Eccl. 3-7 contain warnings about senselessness and confusion of the life not centred on God. 
    Eccl. 8-12 show the highest meaning in life, i.e. looking above the sun (to God) (8:12).
    
    What is the key word in the book of Ecclesiastes (2:11)? 
    The problem which faced Solomon was how he could find happiness and meaning to life apart from God. Read 1:1-3; 2:4-6; 5:4; 7:1; 3:1-4; 7:12; 2:1, and mention at least 5 areas that failed Solomon in his attempt to find satisfaction in life?
    
    What is the portion of sinners in the land of the living (2:26)? In view of Eccl. 8:12; 12:13, what is the duty of man as regards his relationship with God? Everyone has to FEAR God and consequently be assisted to love and desire to do His will (Ps. 110:10)
    
    Explain the essence of unity in view of Solomon's submission in Eccl. 4: 9-12). 
    Who will bring every deed of man to judgement, according to Solomon (Eccl. 12:13-14)?`

    content: `The book of Proverbs is very practical because it concerns the believer's daily walk. It does not include much doctrine, but it does emphasise practical godly living. The book is our daily manual that instructs us in detail on how to walk worthy of our calling as God's people in a corrupt world (cf. Tit. 2: 10). Even unbelievers recognize the value of Proverbs as a manual for conduct. How much more should it apply to Christians, who have the indwelling Spirit to help them live a worthy life. Similarly, we find in the book of Ecclesiastes that we can never find satisfaction, happiness, and meaning to life apart from Christ. True happiness outside Christ is impossible. The inference of the book that all is vanity and vexation of spirit is the verdict on those who choose to seek happiness in anything other than God, through our Lord Jesus Christ. Above all, Jesus is the beginning of all in proverbs, and is the end of all in Ecclesiastes, the beginning and the end of life.`

    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The book of the Song of Solomon, also known as Song of Songs, is a poetic book with 8 chapters. It takes its title from 1:1: The Song of Songs, which is Solomon's. The original Hebrew version of the book titled it "The Song of Songs," shows that the writer considered it the greatest of all songs. The title eventually took on Solomon's name because of the mention of his name throughout the book (1:5;3:7,9,11; 8:11-12), thus supporting the traditional view that Solomon wrote it.

    It is a series of lyrical poems organised as a lengthy dialogue between a young woman and her lover. It was written during King Solomon's reign. Solomon is affirmed as the author of this Book by the Traditional scholars, based on 1 Kings 4:29-34. Marriage is God's first institution (Gen. 2:18). This book reveals the sensual love expressed only within the marriage of a man and a woman.
    The sensual nature of the book has made some people in some quarters to query Its canonisation, asking why it should have been included in the men of the Bible. It was included in the Hebrew Bible and later, Christian versions of the OT because of the attribution to Solomon. Early biblical scholars long maintained that the love story is a metaphor of God's love for man, of the intensity of divine love within the human heart. Most importantly, it prefigures the relationship between Christ and His Church (Christ's Bride) of Eph. 5:22ff), May the Lord help us as we journey through the book

    content: `This book stands out as a single poem that frankly discusses physical love between a married couple. It is a demonstration of the beauty of the marriage relationship in its fullness. 
    
    The book's theme verse 7:10. Compare that with 6:3. Relate that with what happens between the bride and groom as they prepare for the wedding, profess their desire for each other, and are finally united (1:15,16; cf. Gen. 2:23). 
    
    Any correlation of these verses with the relationship between Christ and His Church?
    
    A critical look at Song of Solomon shows an arrangement by character:
    
    1. The bride-hard-working shepherd girl (1:6); 
    2. The bridegroom-handsome and stately shepherd (cf. 3:6-11); and 
    3. The chorus-community of people celebrating the couple's love and union.
    
    • Song of Solomon is another book aside Esther in the Bible in which there is no direct mention of God in the original Hebrew. One wonders. There is close allusion in the last chapter, when the bride compares jealous love to a blazing flame (8:6). . 
    
    Nevertheless, it gives us a biblical look at human love-attraction, lovesickness, and something similar to a great wedding night (chap. 7).
    
    God ordained marriage (His first institution) to be between a man and a woman (Gen. 2:18-25). SoS 8:7 gives a picture of powerful, all consuming love that should cement the marriage.
    
    • Solomon uses many parallels to describe his bride. Let your love always draw you to your spouse (2:8,10,14). Lavish praises and admiration on him/her (4:7;5:2,10-16;6:4).
    
    However, just as pleasant as these things may be, it should be between married couples. Do not awaken love before the appropriate time (2:7; 3:5;8:4). Abstain from sexual immorality (Heb. 13:4).
    
    • This book depicts the dialogue between spouses about their relationship. Communication is key in marriage, and shouldn't be taken lightly.
    
    Do you spot with your spouse at all (Gen. 24:8; Pro. 5:15-20)`

    content: `The book of Isaiah contains the vision that God gave to prophet Isaiah, Tone one of the major prophets in the Bible. According to the opening statement, Isaiah ministered to both Judah and Jerusalem during the reign of 4 different kings of Judah (Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah) (v. 1). Isaiah was the son of Amoz. He was married and had two sons. According to Rabbinical tradition, Isaiah was sawn asunder in the trunk of a carob tree by the order of King Manasseh, when he was 90 years old (cf. Heb. 11:37).

    Isaiah is like a miniature Bible. Like the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament, the first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah consist of judgement upon immoral and idolatrous men. The remaining twenty-seven chapters, like the books of New Testament, which are twenty-seven in number, declare assage of hope. The Messiah is coming as the Saviour to bear the cross and wear the crown In fact, there is no Bible book that speaks about the yel Jesu Christ as the coming Messiah like Isaiah. He stated what the Messiah would be coming to do for His people. Isaiah is to the OT what the mini boekk of as to the NT-filled with rich theological truth.

Sin dullens the sensitivity and productivity of anyone who allows himself to be entangled by it, just like the people of Judah (5:1ff).

    Chaps. 25-31: Despite planning to destroy the wicked from the earth, God still has loving mind for His faithful people. He will always leave a remnant to sing songs of salvation (26:1ff). It is foolish to seek help and counsel from sources other than God (30:1-31:1-3)
    
    Chaps. 32-41,62: God promised to enthrone righteousness in the land, so that everyone (the leaders and the led) would deal in righteousness. When that happens, it indicates God's reign, and would bring assurance of salvation and glory for Zion.
    
    Chaps. 42-54: My servant... (42:1) points to Christ, the Messiah (42:1-4; cf. Matt. 12:18-21). It could also refer to Israel, God's instrument to reach the Gentiles (43:10; 44:1ff).
    
    • 45:1-5: One of Isaiah's most remarkable prophecies was the naming of Cyrus, king of Persia, the ruler who would conquer the Babylonians and release Israel from exile (cf. 44:28). The prophecy was fulfilled when, along with the Medes (cf. 13:17), Cyrus won several important victories before sending his troops against Babylon. Isaiah presented him as one anointed by the LORD to bring deliverance for Israel. Chaps 55-66: God is the God of all flesh, and wishes that all come to His knowledge (cf. 55:1). Everyone... includes both the Jews and Gentiles in God's programme (56:1ff; 65:1). 
    61:1ff: This finds perfection in the life of Jesus (Lk. 4:16-22). Jesus Himself alludes more to Isaiah than any other OT prophet (Matt. 5:6; Lk 7:27;8:10; 11:41; 20:17-18; Jn. 1:23).

Isaiah recognised his inadequacy the moment he encountered the LORD. As a matter of fact, none of us is adequate in ourselves, but our adequacy/sufficiency is in the grace of God, made possible through the righteousness of Christ.

King Ahaz and Manasseh had set up a system whereby their God given children were sacrificed to idol, just in the manner of the gentile nation around them. This and many more infuriated God. In the midst of these, God raised prophet Jeremiah to persuade, appeal to, and warn Israel of he consequences of their sin. Nevertheless, rather than seeing Jeremiah's message as God's tool of mercy and warning to avert the calamity that was see to befall them, they attacked the walling prophet and refused to listen. God cried out His words; Israel was invaded by King Nebuchadnezzar. The vasion let Jerialem in ruins and sorrow. This led to a great lamentation.

    content: `An average Bible reader sees the Book of Ezekiel more as a perplexing web of incoherent visions. No wonder some shy away from studying Lit, despite the fact that it is one of the great literary and spiritual portions of the OT.

    Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi (1:3) is the book's writer. His name means "God will strengthen" or "God will harden." He was a priest like Jeremiah (Jer. 1:1) and Zechariah (Zech. 1:1; cf. Neh. 12:4,16). These 3 were the only prophet-priests in the OT. Ezekiel lived in exile in Babylon during and after Jerusalem's fall in 586 BC. His priestly background explains in part his emphasis on the Jerusalem temple, the LORD's glory, the priests' actions, and God's future temple.

    The book of Ezekiel abounds with sublime visions of the divine glory, and awful denunciations against the rebellious Israel and the abominations of their idolatry. It also contains similar denunciations against 7 hostile nations. The latter part of the book contains oracles regarding the return and restoration of God's people to their land, and God's kingdom would be established on earth. Its main theme is God's message to a people who have lost touch with Him. This theme runs through the book's 3 major divisions: Judgement on Judah (chaps. 1-24), Judgement on Gentile Nations (chaps. 25-32), and Blessings on Israel (chaps. 33-48). The key verses are Ezekiel 36:26; 37:5. These messages he presented in dramatic and forceful ways, thus getting the people's attention, so they would respond.`

    • Ezekiel emphasises God's glory and character throughout the book (1:28; 3:12,23; 8:4; 9:3; 10:4,18-19; 11:22-23; 39:11,21; 43:2-5; 44:4). God's character pervades the book (20:9,14,22,39,44; 36:20-23,23; 39:7,25;43:7-8; cf. 6:7,10,13-14).
    
    Ezekiel condemns Judah and Jerusalem (chap. 3) for idolatry, disobedience, disloyalty, rebellion and unrepentance, for which they would be destroyed (chaps. 4,5,8,9). The readiness and authenticity of this divine verdict is portrayed in 7:2,6. God's judgement is surely coming on the disobedient. Escape now! (Heb. 2:3)
    
    God is at the threshold (chaps. 8-11) means that the abomination of the people was driving Him away from their midst (9:3; 10:4). Sadly, God isn't in some churches, yet they rejoice in the Lord. Why? Sin!
    
    Would they have gone into exile, if they had obeyed God? Obedience is non-negotiable (1 Sam. 15:22). 
    
  • Ezekiel also conveys messages of destruction of 7 enemy nations: Amon (25:1-7), Moab (25:8-11), Edom (25:12-14), Philistia (25:1517), Tyre and Sidon (chaps. 26-28), Egypt (chaps. 29-32). No one disregards God's way and goes scot free. All sinners will be punished, both son and slave. 
  
  When God knew He would judge the enemy nations, why did He allow His own children to fall into their hands? They were raised as "rebels" and they would also regret the roles they played
    
    Ezekiel also assures that God's people will be restored: Israel will triumph while God's kingdom will be established on Earth (chaps.33-39) with the Messiah coming to establish the reign of prosperity and peace (chaps. 40,48). 
    
    Contrast in Ezekiel: The Holy God cannot mingle with unholy people and prophets. False prophets versus God's prophets. Watchmen versus belly men (chap. 34) 
    God promised to restore them and give them new hearts - national revival (36), Revival (genuine) normally begins from the heart. 
    Jesus in Ezekiel: The tender shoot (17:22), the One who has the right to Judge (21:27), coming to judge the world.`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Daniel`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The book of Daniel is traditionally believed to have been written in the T 6th cent. BC. by Daniel, a Palestinian Jew taken captive along with others, to Babylon, by King Nebuchadnezzar's army, about 605 BC. He soon became highly involved in the government of Nebuchadnezzar's kingdom (2:48). Daniel's civil service continued into the Persian period as well (1:21;5:30-6:3).

    The language of the book is partly Hebrew and partly a dialect of Aramaic, which has been called Chaldee, or Biblical Aramaic. This Aramaic is almost the same as that which is found in portions of Ezra. The book isn't intended to give an account of Daniel's life. No wonder it says nothing about his lineage or age. It also recounts just few of the events of his long career. It also doesn't aim to fully account for the history of Israel during the exile in Babylon. Instead, it shows how the God of heaven controls and directs the forces of nature and the history of nations by His providential guidance, miraculous interventions, foreknowledge and immense power, to accomplish His eternal redemptive plan for His servants and people.
    
    God is revealed in the book of Daniel as the ultimate sovereign God (YAHWEH). He had severally warned His people, Judah, but they chose to reject His words and directives, treating them with reckless abandonment. God, who would not also condone sin, gave them up to their enemies. The Babylonian King Nebuchadnezzar, utterly devastated their land and the temple, took them captive out of the Promised Land to a strange land of the enemies. These caused God's enemies to believe their gods had power over the God of Israel. Daniel and his friends found themselves among the captives taken to Babylon, but they carried YAHWEH with them, thus enabling them to stand on their feet, even when there were temptations to compromise their faith. Their godly decisions did not only deliver them from God's enemies, but the God of Israel was proclaimed and seen as the supreme/sovereign God, even among the Gentiles.`

    content: `The fact that Daniel was told to shut up the words, and seal the book... (12:4) is a strong internal evidence that Daniel wrote this Book (cf.chaps. 7-10. How does the words of our Lord Jesus in Matt. 24:15; Mk. 13:14 (cf. 11:31; 12:11) confirm this?

    • Daniel encourages God's people that God would keep His promises to Abraham and David-the Messiah would come (9:24-27); His kingdom would soon fill the entire earth (2:35,44), and His saints would rule and reign with Him (7:22, 27).
    
    • Read 3:29; 6:26-27; cf. 9:3-19. How does Daniel show how God manifests Himself in a way that makes even foreign rulers who earlier think He is too weak to deliver His people, to greatly respect Him?
    
    • Daniel's teachings on angels and the resurrection are more detailed than elsewhere in the OT. He peculiarly attributes names, ranks and functions to them. As to resurrection, see 12:2.
    
    • The Book portrays the kingdom of God as an everlasting one, unlike the kingdoms of men, like those in Daniel. Also, a kingdom is coming that will totally put to an end the kingdoms of men-the Second Coming and reign of Christ. 
    
    • What can the NT Christian learn from how the young but well-nurtured Daniel refused to sacrifice his eternal destiny upon the altar of the gentile king's delicacies (1:8)
    
    • What makes Daniel and his 3 friends risk their lives for YAHWEH on  different occasions when they were prohibited from worshipping Him, by their foreign captors?

Sadly, so many so called Christians today are sources of ungodliness and wickedness in the land. They have lost their flavours as salt, and refused to shine as light to this dark and godless generation. God commands us to evangelise (Mk. 16:15-16). 
    
    Hope you are not part of those who have tactically neglected this divine assignment, running after the perishable things of this world. Daniel influenced his world to the extent that King Darius could decree and declare to all nations on earth that they should fear and tremble before the God of Daniel (6:25-27; cf. 2:47). Our constant interactions and relationships matter a lot to turn the world around for Christ.`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Genesis`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `According to Hosea 1:1, the human author of this prophecy is Hosea, son of Beeri. The events in the reigns of the kings mentioned in 1:1 are recorded in 2 Chronicles 26-32. Hosea, the only prophet to come from the northern kingdom of Israel, ministered during the final times of that area, until Samaria was destroyed by the Assyrians (2 Kgs. 14:23-29; 15:8-31; 17:1-23; Hos. 11). He was a contemporary with Isaiah, Joel, Amos, and Jonah. He predicted, instructed, reproofed and assured the people, during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah-about 60 years. Nothing is known of the family or particular history of Hosea beyond what's recorded in this book. His language and the general compass of his prognostics show that he belonged to the Northern Kingdom. The book of Hosea is an awful little book. It shows God's love and concern for His people, dramatically pictured. No matter what our sins are, God is always willing to forgive when we return to Him, with a repentant heart. This book provides an excellent "object-lesson" in God's love and remission.

    Hosea began his ministry near the end of a period of military success and prosperity for both Israel and Judah (cf. 2 Kgs. 14:25-28; 2 Chron. 26:2,6-15), During the first half of the eighth century, Assyrian influence in the West had declined, allowing the kingdoms of Jeroboam II and Uzziah to flourish. However, the situation soon changed. As foreseen by Hosea, the policy under Tiglath-Pileser III (745-737 B.C.) revived their expansionist t the West. In 733-732 B.C. the Northern Kingdom was made a puppet state within the Assyrian Empire (2 Kgs. 15:29). After plotting revolt, Israel was defeated in 722 BC by the Assyrians and Israel's people were deported (2 Kgs. 17:1-6:18:10-12). Also, Judah was incorporated as a vassal state into the Assyrian Empire during Hosea's time (cf. 2 Kgs. 16:5-10).`

    content: `Humanly speaking, how do you feel about a prophet of God like Hosea going ahead to marry a harlot? Why would God allow such a 'bizarre thing? God's people were harlots, yet He loved them. Out of His love, He punishes without abandonment.

    Hosea exposes Israel's breach of divine covenant (cf. Deut. 28:1-14), and announces God's intention to implement the covenant curses (cf. Deut. 28:15-68), i.e. disobedience would bring Judgement and eventually, exile. It also affirms the Deuteronomic promise of Israel's ultimate restoration (cf.Deut. 30:1-10). 
    
    3 major themes run through Hosea:
    
    1. Sin. Hosea emphasises Israel's idolatry (e.g. 4:17; 8:4,6; 10:5; 11:2; 13:2; cf. 2:8,13; 11:2; 13:1), illustrating this by the prophet's marriage to an unfaithful woman. Israel's other sins include social injustice (12:7), violence (4:2; 6:9; 12:1), religious hypocrisy (6:6), insurgency (7:3-7), foreign alliances (7:11; 8:9), selfish arrogance (13:6), and spiritual ingratitude (7:15).
    
    2. Judgement (1:2-9; 2:2-13; 4:1-5:14; 6:4-11:7; 11:12-13:16). Hosea's calls to people for repentance, doesn't anticipate a positive response. Judgement was inescapable. The LORD would cause them to experience woes, including exile. Hosea emphasises God's justice in that His divine punishment fit the crimes perfectly.
    
    3. Salvation (1:10-2:1; 2:14-3:5; 5:15-6:3; 11:8-11; 14:1ff). However, the LORD would not abandon Israel totally. The severe Judgement is punitive; to bring Israel back to God, as illustrated by Hosea's own reconciliation with his wayward wife.
    
    • The first part of the book (chaps. 1-3) relates Hosea's family life (his relationship with his adulterous woman) to convey the message the prophet had from the LORD for His people. The affair graphically represents the LORD'S relation to the Israelites (cf. 2:4,9,18), who had been disloyal to Him through idolatry, hence God's judgement on them-exile (7:16; 9:3,6,17; 11:5). But the LORD still loves His covenant people, and would restore them, like Hosea did to Gomer (1:11:2:14-23; 5:11:10-11:14:4-7).
    
    Israel's sin, majorly idolatry, and others including lying, murder, stealing, drunkenness, foreign alliances, and hypocrisy, separated them from God. God wants us to develop a faithful marriage relationship with Christ as the partner of the Church (2 Cor. 11:2; Eph. 5:22-33). God wants us to avoid the errors of disobedience, love for the world, and replacing God with idols.
    
    Hidden sin does not stay hidden forever, and the sin we think we can cover up will eventually be exposed (2:10). In fact, He who covers his sins will not prosper (Prov. 28:13a). Sin that festers on the inside, smells on the outside.
    
    The things we do in secret often hurt those closest to us, including God. Gomer's adultery hurt more than just Gomer. It also broke Hosea's heart (7:2). The same is true of God, who sees and feels the things we do in secret.
    
    More important than God's Judgement is His love. Hosea reminds us of God's love in History, mostly in the Exodus. God's compassion and love overshadow His wrath (14:4; cf. Jn. 15:13; 1 Pet. 1:18-19).

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Joel`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The book of Joel is one of the prophetic books of the Bible which talks so much about the day of the Lord. The internal evidence shows that the book was written by, and named after Joel, the son of Pethuel (1:1). Unlike most other prophetic books, no information is given in the opening verse that establishes the time limits of his prophetic ministry. It describes the disaster that struck the southern kingdom of Judah. An ominous black cloud descends upon the land-the dreaded locusts (1:4). 
    
    One of the central themes of the book of Joel is the day of the LORD (1:15; 2:1). This language describes a period in which God "comes down" in a dramatic way, with His wrath and judgement on the wicked, and salvation to the righteous. However, despite the book starts on a platter of doom and destruction, as a result of God's wrath upon the people of Judah and Jerusalem, it also portrays the people's repentance as well as God's promises to restore all their losses and make them rejoice again (cf. 2 Chro. 7:14; Psa. 30:5). Joel, Hebrew Yoel, means "YAHWEH IS God." In Greek Joel is loel and Joel Latin.`

    The plague of chapter 1 and the army of chapter 2 are both instruments of the LORDS Judgment-one past, the other future. Locusts had come - more "locusts were coming!
    
    The description of the locust plague uses extensive figurative language. The locusts are described as a "nation" (1:6a), having "teeth of a lion, the fangs of a lioness" (1:6b), a "large and mighty army" (2:3, 5, 11), "horses" (2:4-5), a "cracking fire" (2:5), "warriors" and "soldiers" (2:7). Fire is apparently a figure of speech for the drought that plagued the land at the same time as the locust plague (1:19; 2:3). However, the movement of the locusts is also compared to the sound of fire (2:5).
    
    The day of the LORD. In the ancient Near East, a mighty warrior-king could consummate an entire military campaign in a single day. The day of the LORD conveys the idea of the LORD'S intervention in Israel's early wars; a phrase used to stress the swift and decisive nature of the His victory over His enemies.
    
    The day of the LORD sometimes involves God's Judgement on His people (at the hands of the Assyrians (Lam. 1:12; 2:1,21-22; Ezk. 7:19; 13:5; Amos 5:18,20; Zeph. 2:2-3).
    
    It can also involve divine Judgement of Gentile nations (Isa. 13:6,9; 34:89; Jer. 46:10; Ezk. 30:3; 39:8). 
    
    It brings purification and restoration for Israel (cf. Isa. 61:2; Mal. 4:5), but also intense misery (Zech. 14:1-3). Joel conveys 3 elements of The day of the LORD:
    
    ✓ Israel's Judgement, threatened (1:15; 2:1-11);  
    ✓ Israel's deliverance, foreseen (2:28-32); and  
    ✓ Universal Judgement on the nations, depicted (3:1ff). 
    
    Read Zeph. 1:7-18; Zech. 14:1-2; Matt. 24:21; 2 Pet. 3:10,12-13; cf. Dan.12:1). What other events would The day of the LORD include? • 
    
    2:28-32: The most important part of Joel's prophecy for the Christian is the prophecy regarding the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. This is an outstanding insight into the church age (cf. Acts 2:16).
    
    • 3:1ff: As God's people enjoy restoration, the wicked nations that plunders them, would face God's wrath (v. 2). No matter the fate we suffer in the hands of the wicked, God would soon bring to book all His enemies`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Amos`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The Book of Amos was likely written by prophet Amos (1:1). Amos was a shepherd who lived in the region of Tekoa, (not many miles from the city of Jerusalem). He made his living by raising sheep and taking care of sycamore trees. When his produce was ready for market, he went to the towns and villages of Israel (7:14-15). His journeys took him through the country districts, where he observed the hardships imposed on the working class of people by the wealthy landowners who lived in the towns, or cities in the midst of comparative luxury. While in the cities, Amos was deeply troubled not only by the contrast between the rich and the poor but by the way in which the political and religious leaders tried to justify this disparity. 
    
    YAHWEH materially rewards those who are faithful in the performance of their ritualistic obligations to Him. Hence, they interpreted their own prosperity and that of the nation as a whole as evidence that the divine favour rest on them and will continue to do so for all time to come. At the same time, they reasoned that poor people deserve their hard lot in life because they do not regularly participate in the sacrifices and other religious activities practiced at the established places of worship. The theme of the book involves concepts like social justice, God's omnipotence, and divine judgement.

    The state of Amos society provided him with grounds for his ministry and it also provides us with grounds for considering that he will have something to say to us today.`

    content: `• The message of Amos is not a happy type in the Scripture; it does not contain encouragement; it speaks almost unending gloom and doom.

    • The book reveals a total decline in societal standard among God's people (5:10-12; 5:1-2; 6:8), motivated by abused affluence, exploitation and godless profit (3:15;4:1 6:6).
    
    Amos emphasises the moral character of YAHWEH, the righteous Ruler of all nations (5:21-27).
    
    Amos oracles are against foreign nations and Israel (1-2), and of indictment against Israel for her sins and injustices (3-6). These lead to words of divine judgement (7-9).
    
    • The great economy and the prosperity whereby the rich got richer and the poor getting poorer, that makes social injustice rampant during the reign of king leroboam II was not of God's pleasure. Is that not the order of the day everywhere today? How can this be curbed? What should we say about capitalism or any other harsh economic system that is not people-oriented? Christians should take Amos' message seriously. 
    
    In Amos 8:11,12, there is a prophecy that in the last day, there will be famine. This is not of food but the Word of God. Is it happening? How can we not be affected by this virus?
    
    The study of the book of Amos should lead to action, rooted in the hope we have in Christ Jesus (Heb. 10:24). • True religion is about responding to grace and the law with a life of obedience and resting on grace for forgiveness. 
    
    God puts His people on the same level as the surrounding nations. He expects the same purity of them all (3:2).
    
    . God still rules over all nations, not just His chosen people. He still opposes nations that violate human rights, and He will judge them.

The long-term struggle between Esau (Edom) and Jacob (Israel) in Rebekah's womb had continued till the Babylonian captivity of Judah. 
    
    The book foretells the eventual punishment of the Edomites as they aided the Babylonian army in capturing Judah, instead of assisting their brother, Judah, against the foreigner who invaded them. The book emphasises the nearness of the Day of the LORD, the judgement of God on Edom, and promises deliverance and holiness for God's people.`

    content: `. God is in control of the affairs of mankind. He is the sovereign God who has all power to raise and pull down (Obad. 1-2). Compare this with Psa. 115:3. What do these mean to you? What are the implications for our Christian living?

    The Edomites were proud in their hearts (v. 3). The pride of location (vv. 3-4), of wealth (vv. 5-6), of alliances (v.7), and of wisdom and armies (vv. 8-9) would not stop them from being brought down (v.4). Compare with God's attitude to the proud in James 4:6. What should we do? 
    
    God does not punish without a cause. Edom ganged up with the foreigners against his brother, Jacob (vv. 10-11). Never rejoice over the downfall of anyone, not even your brother, for the LORD who repays everyone is watching (2 Chron. 16:9). The LORD frowns at the attitude of the Edomites (vv. 12-14). Hope you don't launch into celebration when you hear your perceived enemies encounter disasters or death? That isn't God's attitude (Matt. 5:43ff).
    
    The Edomites caused the children of Judah more pain. They hindered those who wanted to escape and cut them off. They betrayed them into their enemies hands (vv. 14).
    
    .Edom punitively maltreated God's people. However, the Day of the LORD upon all nations is near to set things right (vv. 15-16). The Day of the LORD is a day of judgement against God's enemies and His people's, but a day of vindication for His devoted worshippers.
    
    . The ultimate judgement on Edom is finally proclaimed by the LORD who sees all (vv. 1-9). They would be totally annihilated from by the LORD (V. 18b). 
    
    God is the Deliverer and Restorer. He will not leave His people in captivity, for He always finds a way out for them (v. 17).
    
    • The LORD foretold the deliverance of His people, restoration of territories to His people, and then establishment of His kingdom (17-21).`

However, it is common in our contemporary world that when a Christian falls, especially a minister of the gospel, fellow Christian brethren, rather than trying to stand by him and help him back on his feet, they gloat over him. This kind of attitude is not good at all. Therefore, it has to change. Christians have to be their brothers' keepers (Gen. 4:9). You get nothing by gloating over your fellow brother who falls. Nevertheless, through prayers and encouragements, such can be restored to the fold. Remember the day of the Lord is coming upon the nations of the world (Rev. 22:11-12).`

    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The book of Jonah is the 5th book of the 12 Minor Prophets, in the traditional arrangement of the books of the OT. It is a literary narrative, rather than a series of prophetic oracles. It gives the account of Jonah's experiences after he disobeyed a command from the LORD directing him to preach to the people of Nineveh. The book of Jonah gives us an account of how this man of God, the son of Amittai, tried to defy God's order for him to preach repentance to the people of Nineveh (1:2,3). 
    
    He actually jumped that order as he travelled in the opposite direction to his mission place, but God, in His sovereignty, moved and brought him back into the assignment which he eventually did reluctantly. In any case, it led to the worldwide revival among the Ninevites. The book depicts the larger scope of God's purpose for Israel: that she might rediscover the truth of His creation, and that she might better understand her own role in carrying out that concern. The Hebrew Yonah (translated Jonah') is the word for dove. 2 Kings 14:25 reveals that Jonah was a contemporary of Jeroboam II of Israel.`

    The purpose of Jonah is to show that God's grace is not limited to the Hebrew people, as in the book. God's mercy isn't the exclusive right of a set of people. It is available to all, through repentance. Every sinner is a potential saint before God; don't write anyone off. 
    
    1:10ff: Jonah's disobedience endangered the lives of others. We must obey God's Word, because our disobedience can hurt others. 
    
    2:1ff. God isn't interested in the sinner's death or destruction (Ezk. 33:11). He saves and delivers. He saved Jonah from drowning, preserved him for 3 days, and listened to his prayer in the belly of the fish (cf. Matt. 12:38-41; Lk. 11:32).

He made no attempt to follow up his proclamations with teachings about the true and living God. There was neither discipleship nor follow-up included in his ministry. And as a result, the revival in Nineveh did not continue. 
    
    It was these same people who later captured, exiled and devastated Israel. Had Jonah really been faithful to teach these people properly, perhaps this disaster could have been averted.

Jer. 26:18).Micah was a country prophet. At the time of his ministry, there was great oppression of the poor by the rich. And the Lord used his prophecy to deal with the sins of a morally unjust society.

    Micah prophesied during the crucial years surrounding the tragic fall of Israel to the Assyrian Empire (722 BC), an event he also predicted (1:6). In the book's introduction, Micah stated that he prophesied during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah in Judah, though he didn't mention the simultaneous string of dishonourable kings that finished the northern kingdom of Israel.`

    ✓ The judgement on Israel and Judah (1:1-3:12), and 
    ✓ The restoration of God's people in the millennial kingdom (4:1-5:15).
    
    These two, Judgement and restoration, in turn, inspire fear and hope, two basic ideas set out in the final part of the book, with a scene like a courtroom in which the people stand trial before their Creator for their apostasy (6:1-7:20).
    
    In chapters 1-3, Micah prophetically and sternly condemned the rich and the leaders who took advantage of the poor, callously abusing the less privileged, and perpetuated injustice in the society. He predicts destruction for both Samaria and Judah, but concludes with a message of hope and restoration for the faithful remnant.
    
    . What gave this man from small village such an audacity (3:8)? 
    
    . Micah provides one of the most significant OT prophecies of Jesus Christ's birth, most especially, His birthplace of Bethlehem and to His eternal nature, some 700 years before Christ's birth (5:2).
    
    . It also specifies a very articulate picture of the world's future when the Prince of Peace reigns (5:5). What would characterise this future Millennial Kingdom?
    
    ✓ The presence of many nations living peacefully and securely with
    
    one another (4:3-4), and
    
    ✓ Coming to Jerusalem to worship the reigning king, Jesus Himself (4:2). 
    
    The greatest hope is that, though the Davidic kingdom would seem to come to an end, it would reach greater heights through the coming Messianic deliverer (5:1-4). 
    
    Chapters 6-7 remind the people of God's mighty acts on their behalf. But their injustice, violence and greed are hard to ignore. So, He would bring judgement upon them. Once again, there is hope of restoration for the faithful remnant.`

    content: `What comes to your mind when you consider God as loving and at the same time, the God of Retribution who doesn't let go sin? Or can God once pardon, and still punish thereafter? The answer for both is emphatically Yes. Sin must be punished; rules and boundaries must be respected to enjoy God to maximum. Over a hundred years after Jonah preached to Nineveh, God sent another prophet, Nahum, to pronounce its doom. The book of Nahum demonstrates how false the view is that "might makes right." The great Assyrian empire of which Nineveh was the capital, boasted its might and wealth, but it did not acknowledge its sin, nor listen to God. The fall of such proud nation was inevitable, as the text of Nahum reveals.

    The Book of Nahum is the 7th of the 12 books of the Minor Prophets. This brief prophetic book was written by a prophet whose name means "comforter" or "consolation". We know nothing else about Nahum exce that he came from Elkosh (1:1), the location of which is uncertain. He was a prophet in Judah, since the Northern Kingdom (Israel) had already b conquered by the Assyrians, and its people exiled (2 Kgs. 15:29, 17:6). He was a contemporary of Zephaniah, Habakkuk and Jeremiah (2 Kgs. 17-25).

    Chapter 1 focuses on a clear and bold description of God's character w righteous judge, and more so his wrath (justified anger and judgement) which guaranteed judgement of the wicked (1-7). The verdict is clear Nineveh is certain to receive the doom of God's judgement (8-15).
    
    Chapter 2 predicts Nineveh's approaching judgement and describes descriptive language what the destruction would look like.
    
    Chapter 3 highlights in brief Nineveh's offences against God and declares that God is justified in bringing complete judgement and destruction on the city of Nineveh. Mercy unheeded finally brings judgement. Nahum remind us of the essential character of God whose story is told in the Bible, a God of goodness and salvation as well as of justice and judgement standing side by side in a way that is finally exhibited in the name and the death of jes Christ on a cross.

    Nineveh is a type of all Nations that turn their backs on God. In our day, proud civilizations are staking everything upon strength of man's power and machines and there is a terrible disregard of God. We see that Nineveh was overthrown because of Her sin (3:1-7) and that her great wealth and strength was not sufficient to save her (3:8-19). Often, nations or man depend on might and power or energy of the flesh to survive, they forget that it is not by might nor by power but by my Strength saith the Lord of Host (Zech. 4:6). Any person or nation that deliberately, finally rejects God, deliberately and finally and fatally elects doom (Job 9:4). Beware of this!`

Why do the righteous suffer? Why doesn't God do something? Why doesn't God clean up this mess? Why? Why? Why? Such questions are hardly new. Centuries before Christ visited this planet, Habakkuk looked around at the violence and wickedness of the world and cried out to God with such questions (1:3,13). The prophet not only asked the mysterious whys that plague mankind, he also received answers to his questions. These answers are relevant to us, today. Habakkuk is unique, in that, it is a dialogue between the prophet and God about people.

    Little is known of Habakkuk the prophet. Whatever the meaning of his name, Habakkuk was a pre-exilic prophet. Some Bible scholars have said that Habakkuk was an officially ordained prophet who took part in temple liturgical singing. He was well-educated, deeply sensitive, and was a poet as he was a prophet. He wrote in a time of international crisis and national corruption when Babylonia had just emerged as a world power. When the Babylonians rebelled against Assyria, Judah found a brief period of relief reflected in the reforms initiated by Josiah. The Assyrians were forced to devote their energies to stop the Babylonian rebellion. The Babylonians finally crushed the Assyrian Empire and quickly proceeded to defeat the once-powerful Egyptians. The crisis internationally was serious. But of even greater concern was the national corruption (2 Kgs. 23:36-24:7; 2 Chron. 36:5-8). Habakkuk wrote his lament over the decay, violence, greed, fighting, and depraved justice that surrounded him. He was like, "Why doesn't God do something?" Godly people ask similar questions from generation to generation.`

Given that Zephaniah prophesied during the reign of Josiah, we realise that his ministry overlapped that of Jeremiah (Jer. 1:2).

    The book is one of the OT books that give prophecies of the end. It is notable for its writing on the Day of the LORD-the judgement day. It derives its name from Zephaniah who God used as a prophet during the reign of Josiah. It is believed that the prophecy of Zephaniah could be one of the factors that led to Josiah's reform. It is believed that Zephaniah's forceful prophecy was a strong factor in the reform of Josiah. The prophecy of Zephaniah was not meant only for the people of Israel, but included other nations-gentiles.
    
    The book talks about the imminent judgement of God, which marks the end. The tile in Hebrew is Tsephan-yah, meaning "Yahweh Hides" or "Yahweh Has Hidden." The day of the LORD is a common theme in the book.

    content: `1:7,14-15: Zephaniah's very prominent theme is the coming Day of the LORD, the Judgement Day which he repeatedly and dreadfully drives home. All that the people had acquired, even silver and gold, wouldn't be able to save them. 
    
    The day of the Lord... refers to the looming danger that was coming on the people of Jerusalem, probably from the Chaldeans. It has two-fold meaning:
    
    1) Locally: God's judgements on Judah (1:7; 3:1-5)-the Babylonian invasion and the destruction of the city and temple; and 
    
    2) Prophetically (eschatologically): A great and final, more distant judgement coming upon the whole earth (1:2-3,18; cf. Matt. 24:1ff; Mk 13:1ff; Lk. 21:1ff; Rev. 6-19).
    
    2:1-3: Despite the impending judgement, the gracious and merciful God was still charging them to seek Him, peradventure a remnant would be preserved by the just and righteous LORD who never delights in the sinner's death (Ezk.33:11). 
    
    In the light of 2:1-3, what are we expected to do to be saved from the fire of God's judgement? 2:4-19: 
    
    Zephaniah's prophecy wasn't meant only for the Jews. Mention some other nations that would be divinely bashed:
    
    1)      2:4-7...... 
    2)      2:8-11...
    3)      2:12......; and
    4)      2:13-15..... 
    
    What would happen to nations that fail to seek the LORD? Is that still relevant today?
    
    3:8ff: Jerusalem would be punished for lack of trust in God, oppression, incorrigibility, rebellion and corruption. Yet, the gracious LORD would preserve a righteous remnant (cf. Rom. 9:27-29).
    
    This righteous remnant would include those of Judah (2:7) as well as the Gentiles who would be among the righteous, worshipping God (3:8-10). 
    
    Draw out the reasons for the divine judgement from the following
    
    verses:
    
    1) 1:4
    2) 1:5a 3) 1:6
    4) 1:8 5) 1:9
    6) 3:1-2,6-7
    7) 3:3-4
    8) 1:12
    9) 1:18
    
    In Zephaniah, we see a relationship between divine judgement and divine blessing. Judgement has much to do with those who chose to be God's enemies while God's blessings and salvation are for His faithful
    
    people. 
    God's judgement does the following: 1) Delivers us from our enemies by it (2:4-15;3:15, 19);
    2) Purifies the righteous remnant (3:9);
    3) Brings about our blessings (2:5-7,9-10); and 
    4) Is a means of removing our sins (3:8-13).
    
    What should be the response to Zephaniah's message? 
    1) be silent (1:7; cf. Lev. 10:3; Neh. 5:8; Job 6:24; Psa. 62:1; 65:1; Hab. 2:20;Zech. 2:13)

The great day of God's judgement is closer than when we first give our lives to Christ. There is therefore the need for us to be wary of this dreaded period, as nobody will be able to endure the anger of God's judgement. 
    
    Very soon, God will destroy sin and the man of sin, devil. Jesus gave the believer the key to unlock this period: Don't be deceived (Matt. 24:4; Mk. 13:5). As the name of Zephaniah implies, only those who seek the Lord out of true heart may be hidden in the day of the LORD'S anger (2:3). Nevertheless, there is always provision for repentance. God is ready to save anyone who seeks Him (cf. Isa. 59:1). Consider your way (Hag. 1:7); don't be incorrigible.`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Haggai`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Haggai is the 10th of the 12 minor prophets-the shortest prophetic book at the end of the OT, and the first of the 3 post-exilic prophetic books in the OT., the others being Zechariah and Malachi. The name most likely, means "festival." We have no information concerning his family or social background. We merely know him as Haggai the prophet (1:1; Ezra 5:1; 6:14). According to Jewish tradition, he was known as a prophet in Babylon, during the Exile. He was among the Jewish colonists at Jerusalem when his prophetic words were recorded (Ezra 5:1-2;6:14).

    The book of Haggai provides helpful insights concerning the rebuilding of the temple in Jerusalem. A poor handful of people had returned to Jerusalem from Babylon where they had lived in captivity. With a colossal task of rebuilding the temple and restoring the worship of Jehovah before them, the Jews laboured under the same old sin, idolatry, inter-marriage with idolatrous neighbours. They were few in number, poor, harassed by enemies and worse, they had lost the inner strength that comes from a joy in the Lord (cf. Neh. 8:10). Because of all these, the work dragged and the people lost heart and became selfish. Neglecting the Lords house, they had become more interested in building homes for themselves than for God (Hag. 1:4). God would not allow this to go on and so, He sent punishment as a result. Poor crops, droughts, scanty trade, misery and turmoil made their spirits fall (Hag. 1:6) They were working and slaving, but finding no real joy (Hag. 1:6,6 11). The Jews obeyed the Word of the Lord through Haggai and succeeded in completing the temple (Ezra 5-6; Hag. 1-2).

    content: `. The words Consider your ways or "Consider (1:5, 7; 2:15,18) that happen to be the key phrase of Haggai's prophecies implies that the purpose of God's messages to the Jewish leadership and people was to awaken them to their spiritual responsibilities. Do we need that today?

    . Read 1:3ff. The major concern of his prophetic ministry was to encourage the people to rebuild the temple, which had been destroyed and abandoned during the years of the Exile.
    
    • The Lord gave Haggai 4 messages for specific individuals:
    
    1. Zerubbabel and Joshua (1:1);
    2. Zerubbabel, Joshua and the remnant (2:2);   
    3. The priests (v. 11); and    
    4. Zerubbabel (v.21).
    
    • Haggai conveyed a twofold message of reproof and encouragement. The returnees needed to be chastised for their indifference, and consoled in the midst of their troubles. God's fulfilment of His promises cannot be judged by appearances.
    
    • Why was rebuilding the temple so important to the lives of the Jews that made God to raise Haggai with such powerful message to them?
    
    • The effect of Haggai's message was profound on the people-a good tonic that gingered Governor Zerubbabel, High Priest Joshua and the people to begin and complete the work (1:12-15).`

    . examine our priorities to see if we are more interested in our own even today. Haggai asks us to: pleasures than doing the work of God; 
    reject a defeatist attitude when we run into opposition or c discouraging circumstances; confess our failures, and seek to live pure lives before God; 
    act courageously for God, because we have the assurance that He is with us always, and is in full control of our circumstances; and rest secure in God's hands, knowing that He will abundantly bless us as we faithfully serve Him.
    
    God sometimes allows hardships, failures, depressions, etc. because of our indifference to Him. But He wants us to keep up the church. Without churches, sin and vice prevail. When men forget to love God, they forget to love their fellow men, too. We should beautify God's house (2 Sam. 7:2). We are not to live in fine houses while our places of worshipping our God lie in ruins. Above all, don't ignore what matters most-your relationship with God, your Creator.`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Zechariah`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Is hope lost for God's people in despair? Zechariah, whose names probably means "the Lord remembers" or "the Lord is renowned," was a contemporary of Prophet Haggai, whose prophetic and priestly career began during the time of Darius of Persia, 520 B C. He likely wrote the book two months after Prophet Haggai's prophecy, calling the people to repent (Hag. 1:1; Zech. 1:1), during and after the building of the Temple to motivate and give hope of a better day. He joined Haggai in arousing the Jews to rebuild the destroyed Jerusalem Temple (Ezr. 6:14). This book provides specific immediate and future messianic prophecies and encouragement to the struggling returnees trying to rebuild the temple. Jesus will come as Saviour, Judge, and ultimately as the righteous King ruling from Jerusalem (14:8-9).

    The book of Zechariah is the longest book of the Minor Prophets, and somewhat difficult to understand, because of the numerous visions that call for an interpreter. An angel is present at some points to interpret the visions (1:9-10,19-20; 4:1-6; 5:5-6). Significantly, the last part of Zechariah (chaps. 9-11) is the most quoted section of the Prophets in the Gospel Passion narratives. Also, Zechariah greatly influenced the book of Revelation.
    
    As a form of background, 1:12; 7:5 show that the 70-year captivity (Jer. 25:11; 29:10; cf. Dan 9:2) was gradually ending in the time of Zechariah. It was about 66 years since Jerusalem fell, when the first word of the LORD came to Zechariah in the 2nd year of Darius 1 (520 BC). The Babylonian Empire had fallen to the Persians in 538 BC, and Cyrus the first king of Persia, signed a decree permitting all captives to return to their homes (2 Chro. 36:23; Ezra 1:1-4). Since Darius came to power in Persia (521 BC), hope arose for Jews in Jerusalem and Babylon. Some of the captives had been back in Jerusalem for 16 years, but nothing was being done about rebuilding the temple. Haggal and Zechariah powerfully preached so that work on the 2nd temple began in 520 BC and was finished in 516 BC (Ezra 5:1, 14-15; Hag. 1-2; Zech.1-8).`

    content: `The book of Zechariah divides into 3 messages: 
      the need for repentance (1:1-5:11);
      the eight night visions (1:7-6:8)-the temple would be rebuilt and God's glory would return to Jerusalem; and
      the coming kingdom of God (chaps 9-14). 
      
    • Encouragement:
    
      Zechariah saw the sinful condition and religious indifference of his people (3:1-10; 5:1-11) and so delivered exhortations that got the people stirred up in rebuilding the Temple at Jerusalem.
    
      To be forewarned is to be forearmed. The nation's history was recalled, to warn that generation as the danger of toeing their father's ugly past (1:1-6)
    
    . The eight symbolical visions may be difficult to interpret but are to console the returnees and arouse their hope (1:7-6:8). meant 
    a. The horses: teaches God's mercy to rebuild His people (1:7-17) 
    b. The four horns and four carpenters: powers that destroyed Judah and what would happen to them (1:18-21)
    c. The man with measuring line: like a surveyor, speaks of God's power
    to protect His own (2:1ff) 
    d. The vision of the high Priest: Judah or God's people would overcome Satan and be cleansed by Jesus blood (3:1-10)  
    e. The lampstand and olive trees: The Lord will give power for success to His people, by the Holy Spirit (4:1ff)
    f. The flying scroll: teaches that dishonest people will be punished (5:1-4) g. The woman in a basket: teaches that wickedness will be removed from the land where God dwells (5:1-11) 
    h. The four chariots: The Lord's power will spread all over the earth (6:1-8).
    
    The decoration and crowning of Joshua the high priest are symbolic of how God helps to remove our iniquity and clothe us with the garment of grace (3:1-4), and earthly kingdoms becoming that of Christ (6:9. 15)-millennial reign prefigured. The memory of the ruins in Jerusalem will no longer be kept as God promises His blessings and presence.
    
    . Though God visited His people in anger because of their sin, He will again visit them to bless and restore. Both first and second coming of Christ are captured in Zechariah's messages, when things shall turn well for all (9 14). Only the remnant shall enjoy these.
    
    QUESTIONS
    
    1. Why did God ask the people to return to Him, in our memory verse? 
    2. What was the devil's justification to cloth Joshua with the filthy garment?
    3. What was the mountain before Zerubbabel? What can God do with the mountains before you?`

    content: `It is easy to be overwhelmed by the depressing circumstances of everyday life we find ourselves and lose focus, thereby losing hope of the future and making us live as people without God.

May we receive the strength and courage to wait patiently to receive Him in Jesus' name. Amen.

    God will not allow His work to suffer lack or delay. He has a way of motivating and mobilising His people to do His work to time, and well. Let us not allow anything to debar us from doing what God has given us to do for Him. No one can disappoint God. God's work would always be done, just that those who refuse to be part of the success story would leave to regret their actions.`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Genesis`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The book of Malachi is the last prophetic book of the Jewish canon. The T same goes with our Old Testament. Malachi' means my messenger or messenger of the LORD. During the 5th century BC, the struggling Jewish community in Judah was greatly assisted by the return of Ezra and Nehemiah (Neh. 5:2-13; 6:15; 10:35-39; 13:6-31). Malachi was written to shake the people of Judah from their spiritual lethargy, and warn them that judgement was coming, unless they repented. The book confronts the believers with their sins and warns us to come back to God, even as we restore our relationship with Him. It also talks about how God loves perfectly, completely and unconditionally. God loves His people, even when they choose to neglect and disobey Him. The writer reprimands the people on their aim for religious freedom and independence. They fail to acknowledge the wonderful love of God but choose to gradually despise His laws and name.

    We are today's Israelites, God has offered this same great love to us, He is now pleading and beseeching us to accept His great offer through Jesus Christ our Lord. We are not different from the past Israelites in the way we view God's glorious offer of love through His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ. Today, we have forgotten God as the Source of our life and existence. Everyone chooses to live according to his/her own selfish interest rather than living according to the biblical standard of a Christian life. Accountability is mandatory. undeniable and irresistible.`

    content: `The signs of spiritual lethargy. Malachi was written to shake the people of Judah from their sin which include that they doubted God's love (1:2) and justice (2:17), and didn't take His commands seriously (1:6; 3:14-18). Yet, God is a great King (1:14) with a great Name, to be feared, even beyond the borders of Israel (vv. 5,11).

    • Israel lost their sense of belonging and their priests have become corrupt (2:1-9), despite the privileges they received from God-divinely chosen, loved and blessed (1:2). The people acted and treated their fellow brothers treacherously, unfaithfully, deceitfully and disloyally.
    
    Discouragement about the Messiah's delay in appearance, and the destruction of God's enemies led to the complacency in obeying God's commandments (2:11-12). Unfaithfulness and the ungodly lifestyle of the priests contributed to the devastating collapse of marriages and family life (vv. 14-15).
    
    Malachi repeatedly urges both the priests and the people to revere God and give him the honour He deserves. God is Israel's Father and Creator (2:10), but the nation showed contempt for His name (1:6; 3:5). A thing that would make God send His messenger to announce the Day of the LORD (3:1; cf.Jn. 2:14-15) and to establish the covenant (3:1-2).
    
    GOD'S PROMISES
    
    • The promise of a messenger and of the Messiah (3:1).
    • The people would be God's treasured possession (3:17a).
    . God's final Judgement would show compassion on those who serve faithfully, and the wicked ones would be judged accordingly (3:17b-18).
    
    . The promise that the night of evil would come to an end (4:2). The day when the evildoers would be destroyed like chaff in the furnace of God's wrath (4:1-3). The only way to escape from God's wrath and the dreadful day, is to fear God, obey His words and live a holy life.
    
    HOW THESE APPLY TO US 
    1. We aren't different from the people in Malachi, as we become callous to God's love towards us, losing focus as we neglect our love for Him, His Word and service.  
    2. No matter the circumstances and situations, God's love over us is constant, because He is our Father and Creator. However, His eternal rewards are for those who remain obedient, and faithful to His laws and leading. God deserves our very best honour and respect.
    3. It pleases God to see His children being faithful, generous, grateful, loving and hopeful. The way we love reflects the sincerity of our love for God. 
    4. It is God's plan to have a pure, righteous and devoted priesthood in His vineyard, to lead His people aright and set a godly example for them to emulate.
    5. There is no doubt about the fact that we are God's representatives here on earth; therefore, we must: . Fear Him in all our endeavours;
    
    . Be faithful to Him and in everything; 
    • Abstain from every form of ungodliness; and
    . Stick to the fact that we are His messengers (the sent).
    
    6. We must do everything possible to build godly and healthy home. Godly passion in marriage relationship helps to keep commitment and intimacy.
    
    7. God hates divorce. Both polygamy and divorce are not conducive to raise
    
    and nurture godly and God-fearing Children (2:1ff; cf. Matt. 19:1ff). 8. Christ's first appearance was to save and purify all those who believe in and accept Him, but His second coming will definitely expose and condemn every act of wickedness and ungodliness.
    
    9. Jesus will perfectly refine and purify at His Second Coming: purify His people (cf. vv. 2-4); and judge the wicked (4:1).`

    content: `Tradition holds that Matthew is the writer of the Gospel according to St. Matthew. The early church fathers unanimously agreed that Matthew, or Levi, the son of Alpahaeus, was a publican. Matthew sees no difference between history and theology. No wonder it has been strongly held that the Gospel of Matthew coming first is no accident. It stands as a superb transition from the OT to the NT; a swinging door that connects the OT reader to the NT. Although, like the OT, the NT isn't written in exact chronological order, the Gospel of Matthew does make the perfect preface for the Jews to the new and better Covenant. For Matthew, the Kingdom of God is the priority. The Book is a perfect ending of the 400-year divine silence between the OT and the NT.

    Matthew has a special appeal to the Jews because of the line of Jesus Chri which he traces all the way back to Abraham, the father of the nation of Israel, wanting them to understand that not only is Jesus King, but also the predicted and long-awaited Messiah. No wonder the phrase repeatedly stressed in the Book is Son of God that appears 8 times in the book. It is the most Jewish of the gospel writings. It presents the most systematic programme for Israel and her Messiah. It mentions the Kingdom of God and Heaven more than any other book in the New Testament.`

    Matthew portrays Jesus as the possessor of authority (7:29). He is the King of the Jews, the Lord indeed of the great King David. To Him belongs the kingdom of heaven.
    
    Mention some of the ways by which Jesus' authority is challenged as the King (11:20-30; 13:1-16:12). 
    
    The Gospel of Matthew reveals what genuine discipleship is-emulating Jesus, pursuing genuine righteousness beyond that of the Pharisees and Scribes (5:1ff). Have you been doing these?
    
    Matthew is the only Gospel containing the word 'Church. Christ builds His Church (16:18,19), for harmony (5:21-24; 6:14,15; 18:5-14), and sacraments (26:27-29). From these Scriptures, what is your definition of the Church? Compare this with what happens in churches today. . 
    
    Matthew foresees the Church's worldwide mission. Jesus intends the gospel to start with the Jews, but laid the foundation for gentiles to come and admit Him as Lord-the visit of the Magi; His interactions with gentiles such as the people from Syria and Decapolis, a Roman centurion, and a Canaanite woman (cf. 21:43).

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Mark`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `This is the 2nd book of the New Testament. John Mark is traditionally held to be the writer of this book about 50-60 AD as suggested, having transcribed the teaching of Apostle Peter. John Mark, was familiar with Peter, Jesus' closest disciple.The Gospel according to Mark has no story of Jesus' birth. Instead, Mark's story begins by describing Jesus' adult life, introducing it with the words, The beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, the Son of God (1:1). He told of John the Baptist, who predicts the coming of a man more powerful than himself. Mark's Gospel stresses the deeds, strength and determination of Jesus in overcoming evil forces and defying the power of imperial Rome. Mark also emphasises the passion, predicting it as early as chapter 8 and devoting the final third of his Gospel (Chaps. 11-16) to the last week of Jesus' life. One of the most striking elements in the Gospel is Mark's characterization of Jesus as reluctant to reveal Himself as the Messiah. Jesus refers to Himself only as the Son of Man (8:27-30)

    The theme of the book is Jesus Christ as the Messiah and the Saviour of mankind. Its central message is that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, has come to the earth that the kingdom of God is at hand, and that all should repent and believe in the gospel (1:15). Basically, Mark aims to share the life story and purpose of Jesus Christ as our Lord and Saviour. He takes a special direction of introducing Jesus as the one with a mission of love and the power to change the world. While other gospels document more parables, Mark shares 21 miracles, 2 of which are unique to his account.
    
    Characteristically, Mark's Gospel is action driven. Mark wrote with much more pace than the other synoptic gospel authors. His style displays a level of repetitions (1:32). The Gospel is written more as a sermon that serves as a motivational call to action.

    He was obviously once a co-traveller with Barnabas and Paul during their first missionary outing (Acts 12:5; 13:5). He went on attrition, a thing that made Paul to reject him on the second journey (Acts 12:25; 13:5; 15:36 39). But he later became mature and useful to even Paul himself (Col.4:10). 
    
    • God promised to send a messenger to prepare the way for His Messiah (Christ). In the light of these prophecies, how did John understand His mission (1:1-9)?
    
    . Note that the Mark's Gospel emphasises what Jesus did rather than what He said. Mark portrays the human side of Jesus. He captures Jesus behaving like a normal human being (4:35-45).
    
    •Right from the start, Mark declares the divinity of Jesus-He is Christ, the Son of God (1:1). He also makes it clear that Jesus is human by telling us about Jesus' emotions - He was moved with compassion (6:34), He sighed (7:34, 8:12), He got tired and went to sleep on a cushion (4:38). Because He was both divine and human, He is the only acceptable Sacrifice for us (10:45). In spite of His divinity, Jesus says He came not to be served but to serve.
    
    . Despite being the most concise of the Gospels, it is aimed at preparing the readers for martyrdom. The believers were passing through the Roman Government's persecution (AD 64-67). It thus prophetically anticipates what would happen to the Church, since Jesus has been presented as our Example.
    
    How does the Galilean ministry of Jesus that 1:1-8:26 account for, describe Jesus?
    
    . In 8:27-10:52, we see Jesus discussing His suffering with His What does that imply for our Christian living (8:34)?
    
    Jesus, in the Gospel of Mark, is portrayed as the prophesied Messiah, the sinless Son of God He claims to be.
    
    Mark's gospel is intended not only to transfer information about Jesus but also impart to the reader an impression of Him.
    
    What instructions show that Jesus wanted them to be devoted wholly to the preaching of the Word, and to not waste any time, and not to follow human tradition(6:8-9;7:10-12)?
    
    Why did the disciples react the way they did when Jesus told them what was going to happen to Him (9:31-32)?
    
    Like record of Matthew, Jesus also instructs the Disciples to go to work for Him, He never forgets to give His assurance (16:14-20) Any Implications?`

    content: `Mark's gospel, though the shortest, shows us the life of Christ like a panorama. It portrays both the humanity and deity of Christ Jesus in a unique manner. Christ's faithfulness to His mission on earth should challenge us to remain focused on all that He has for us. This is made possible by our commitment to his kind of discipleship. Following Jesus means denying yourself, taking up your cross, and following Him till the end.`
