    content: `How do you think the world would look like without the book of Genesis that gives historical validity to the beginning of all things? The world would have been without any accurate record of the creations. The book of Genesis gives the historical accuracy to creation story. God in the book of Genesis proffered solution to the problem of the beginning of all things which science could not give a satisfactory answer. The book of Genesis remains the source. To modern readers, the book of Genesis might appear to be a strange book, beginning, as it does, with God and creation, and ending with Joseph in a coffin in Egypt (50:26)! Indeed, In the beginning, both serves its title, and is suggestive as to what the book is all about. In other words, it tells of the beginning of God's story, creation, human disobedience and divine redemption. It is also the first book of the Pentateuch, and serves as an introduction to the entire Bible, the story of God, choosing and making a covenant with a people through whom He would reach all people (12:2-3).
    The first Hebrew word used in the Book, Bereshith is also used as the title However, the English Bible uses the word "Genesis, which is the Greek translation of the Original Hebrew word. Genesis is a title that reflects what we find in the entire book, for it means "the origin, source or Creation." Obviously, the entire history took place before Moses birth. His role in werfting Genesis would be said to be mainly under the influence of the Holy Spirit to carefully fit together all the available written and oral accounts that we now have present in Genesis.`

These are thought-provoking questions which the mortal man cannot answer, be it scientists, philosophers or astrologers. 
    
    The only person who could really answer these questions for us is God Himself. Without the book of Genesis, our knowledge of a creating God would be pitifully limited and would be woefully ignorant of the beginning of our universe. Through Genesis, God is teaching us that He is the Creator and that He desires relationship with His people. People are special to God and unique. And above all, no matter the situation and no matter the depth of your sin, God loves and wants to use you in His plan. What was the cost in Eden, Genesis 3, is restored to us in Christ Jesus Romans 5:12. He alone is worthy for us to be an extension of His kingdom on earth.Just like the nation Israel was set apart to carry out God's purpose to the world, would you be faithful to carry out God's purpose on Earth?`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Exodus`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Exodus is the second book of the Bible. The name is a Latin word which means 'exit,"departure,"going,' or 'way out. The book, an integral part history-the exit from Egypt. It continues the narrative opened in Genesis and completed by the remaining books of the Law. Someone has said, "Exodus follows Genesis in much the same relation as the New Testament stands to the Old Testament."

    Exodus accounts for the early years of the Israelites, including their birth and earliest development as a nation divinely elected in accordance with God's eternal redemptive plan. In fact, it is predominantly the book of redemption in the Old Testament; and it conveys the design for deliverance/redemption.
    
    Both internal and external evidences support that the book was written
    under divine inspiration (2 Tim. 3:16) by Moses the servant of God, whe doubles as the great hero in the book (cf. Exod. 20:25; 24:4; 34:27; Jos 8:31 Mk. 7:10; 12:26; Lk. 2:22-23). He wrote to reveal God's love and purpose in redeeming an enslaved people from the bondage in Egypt, consecrating them into covenant that established them as His own people, and pitching His royal tent on earth, all through a human mediator.
    
    The book records the call and work of Moses, as a type of Jesus, our Suprem Mediator. It also describes how God instituted the priesthood, and delineates the functions of the prophet. It shows how God's ancien covenant relationship with His people graduated into the Mosaic covenant at Sinai. It reveals God's character of deliverance from Satan, sin and the world, by His character of progressive self-revelation climaxed in the Person of Jesus Christ. It shows that true worship should naturally follow redemption for the redeemed.

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Leviticus`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Leviticus is the 3rd book of the Bible, which was written in continuation of Exodus that narrates the journey of God's people from Egypt through the wilderness. In the wilderness, God commanded Moses to make a Tabernacle for Him, a place of worship, where the people would meet with Him (Exod. 25-31). Having obediently fulfilled the construction of the tent of meeting and the materials therein for holy service, God called on Moses to show him how to serve and worship Him (1:1-2), occasioning the emergence of the book of Leviticus.

    Leviticus was written by Moses, the leader of God's people, used by Him to lead Israel out of Egypt, with great miraculous signs. The book which was written in the wilderness, dates between 1450-1410 BC. The key characters are Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, Eleasar and Ithamar. The key verse is Leviticus 19:2b: You must be holy because I, the LORD your God, am holy. The common themes are holiness, sacrifice and offering. However, holiness is mentioned more times (152) in this book than in any other book of the Bible.`

God specifies beginning from 1:1, describing the offerings and how to make them. 
      
    The sacrifices foreshadow Christ (Heb. 9:9). Chaps 8-10: Aaron and his sons were consecrated before they could do their priestly duties. God doesn't use any vessel that He hasn't first consecrated for His holy use.
    
    Aaron's sons who didn't keep to their consecration terms were divinely struck dead (10:1). Explain some of the things that can constitute strange fire on the altar, today. Chaps. 11-15: God is holy, and His people must be holy (cf. Matt. 5:48; 1 Pet. 1:14-16). He specifically warned them against defilement, to remain holy unto Him.
    
    16:6-17: Atonement is another strong theme in Leviticus. Despite the consecration of His people, God still set apart a day of Atonement (Yom Kippur) when they must atone for their sins, to remove the guilt of sin. Christ has perfected this, once and for all (Heb.9:23). 17:11ff describes the sanctity of blood. Compare this with Heb. 9:22 in the light of Gen. 3:21. What is the place of blood in Redemption?
    
    How can the believer achieve consecration and sanctification today when the blood of goats, rams and cattle are no longer of any effect, because of Christ's perfect sacrifice? It is only gentiles that still sacrifice (1 Cor. 10; 19:2) 18:1ff. God proscribed some sexual practices for His people. Never learn or join with the practices of the heathen. • 23:1ff: God permitted some feasts among His people: Sabbath, Passover, Unleavened bread, First fruits, Feast of Weeks, Trumpets, and Day of Atonement.

    Imagine God's own people wandering and reaching their destination very late, with many of them dying in the wilderness. While it is a fairly short distance from Egypt to Israel, it took the ancient Jews 40 years to get there. This happened because their disobedience and lack of faith caused God to make them wander in the desert until all the people of that generation had died, with a few important exceptions. The book draws its name from the census made of the people, a necessary step toward their organisation and future government. Numbers was written to the people of Israel to document their journey to the Promised Land, but it also reminds all future readers of the Bible that God is with us as we journey to heaven.

To show the imperativeness of stock-taking and accountability, God instructed Moses to take a census of the entire Israelites (1:1-2) and later the Levites (3:14) The most famous passage in Numbers is the Priestly Blessing in 6:24-26

    How significant is that to Christians today? Chaps. 11-21: A lack of an experiential knowledge of God usually brings disaster (cf. Dan. 11:32b). How did that affect Miriam, Aaron and the people themselves (Num. 10:11-14:45)? In Numbers 11, compare verses 1, 10, and 33. What made the Lord so angry? Do you think the same thing makes Him angry today? For 40 years, the people wandered in the desert until the faithless generation was consumed (15:1-21:35).

These events were written as examples for believers (1 Cor. 10:1-12). Sin and unbelief, especially rebellion, usually bring the judgement of God upon anyone (Heb. 3:7-4:13).

    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Though we are not expected to live in the past, yet, it will lead us to how we should live now and in the future. The book of Deuteronomy is a rehearsal or reinstatement of the laws proclaimed at Sinai, with a call to obedience on the part of the new generation. It was written by Moses (1:1; 4:44) about 1406 BC, as addresses delivered to the Israelites at the verge of entering Canaan, at the plains of Moab, to repeat and expound the law to them, so that they would not go the way of their fathers who died within the 40-year wilderness wandering, because of disobedience. Like Leviticus, Deuteronomy contains a vast amount of legal details, but its emphasis is on the laymen, rather than the priests. The Hebrew title of Deuteronomy is Haddebharim, "The words," taken from the opening phrase (1:1), These are the words. Deuteronomy is not a second law, as some claim, but an adaptation and expansion of much of the original Law given on Mount Sinai.

    The English title comes from the Greek title Deuteronomion, "the second law." Some of the notable themes are election, faithfulness, obedience and God s covenant of blessings for His people. The key verses are 18:15-19. The followings are some of the repeated words: all Israel (1:1; 27:9; 31:7...), people of Israel (5:1; 21:8; 32:8...), and children of Israel (1:3; 3:18; 4:45; 23:17...). This is a clear indication that Moses' messages were directed to the entire congregation of Israel. Everybody needs the Word for survival.`

    Expectation and Obligation. In this book, God wants us to know that as much as we expect Him to bless and protect us, we also owe Him obedience to the letter in fulfilling the covenant of election and blessing for our lives (30:19-20). Take Heed: This phrase is frequently repeated in Deuteronomy. It means to be careful and watch out in respect of the followings that would lead us to the fulfilment of God's purpose for our lives: 
    
    i. The giving of the law ((4:9,10)
    
    ii. The Covenant (4:23) iii. The past slavery (5:15)
    
    iv. The great deliverance (7:18) V. The divine leadership and supplies (8:2-6)
    
    vi. The sins of the past (9:7) vii. The divine judgement (24:9) viii. The ancient days (32:7) Commands to Follow: The Ten Commandments are meant for God's people to obey, to enjoy God's benevolence meant for them. The chief of these commands is love for the only One and True God (5:7). Promises: God's promises for His people are most times conditional; hinged on loyalty, obedience and faithfulness (chaps 27, 28). The Three Speeches of Moses hinge on 1. What God has done for Israel (1:1-4:43),
    
    2. What God expects from Israel (4:44-26:19), 3. What God will do for Israel (27:1-43:12).
    
    If you don't appreciate the past dealings of God, you may not value His present benevolence and thus lose His future blessings.
    
    • Contrasts: God is absolutely holy, while man is not. But man should strive to be holy. The righteous are blessed while the unrighteous are cursed (28:1-end). While God did not fail by truly loving Israel as His own people, Israel rejected God many times to have other gods.
    
    Errors to Avoid: The error of undue familiarity with divine things. God has no favourites when it comes to dealing with rebellion against His commands. Majority of the covenant people of Israel didn't get to the Promised Land, even the 'great Moses' himself (Num. 14:20-23; 20:12; Deut. 1:37; Heb. 4:6). What are those things that can deny you of Canaan here and ultimately?
    
    God will do what He will do. Do we have a part to play in actualising God's promises for our lives? 2 Why the need for repetition of God's Word to God's people? 
    
    3. Which portions of Deut. 28:1-68 do you prefer to read? Why?
    
    QUESTIONS:
    
    Deuteronomy is God's way of reminding us that despite His promises for us, we have own part to play in fulfilling His purposes for our lives-total obedience. To facilitate and generate this, we must keep repeating His Word to ourselves and to others. This would facilitate faith and obedience (Rom. 10:17). God chose to reemphasise all He had been telling His people in the wilderness for about 40 years. This underscores the fact that we must continually hear God's Word to remain ever fresh.`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Joshua`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The book of Joshua is the first of the historical books in the English Bible; the first of the Former Prophets (including Judges, the books of Samuel and the books of Kings) in the Hebrew Bible. It begins with YAHWEH'S commission of Joshua (1:1-9) and concludes with the burial of Joshua, Eleazar and the bones of Joseph (24:29-33). It shows how Joshua continued in the footsteps of Moses to divide the Promised Land among God's people, Israel, and how Israel began prospering in the land.

    Tradition agrees that Joshua wrote the book (cf. 24:26). The name 'Joshua' is sometimes spelt "Jehoshua," "Jehoshuah" (1 Chro. 7:27), or "Jeshua" (Neh. 8:17). He is alternately called Jeshua in Ezra-Nehemiah. There are other Joshuas in the Bible (1 Sam. 6:14,18; 2 Kgs. 23:8; Hag. 1:1-14;Zech.3:1-9;Lk. 3:29). The author of the book of Joshua is the son of Nun who was Moses assistant and successor (Exod. 17:8-15). We are talking of the military leader whom God chose to lead the Israelites in the conquest of Canaan (Num, 13:16). By the time of the conquest of the Promised Land, he was an old man (Josh. 19:49-50; 23; 24:15), and he died at the ripe age of 110. He was buried in the land of his inheritance at Timnath-serah (24:29-30).`

    content: `Joshua is a very important figure in the book named after him. How did he become so prominent (1:1-9)?

    Identify the different Joshuas in 1 Sam. 6:14,18; 2 Kgs. 23:8; Hag. 1:1-14; Zech. 3:1-9; and Lk. 3:29. Compare them with the son of Nun (Exod. 17:3 15; Num. 13:16).
    
    One thing characteristic of Joshua's lifetime is that Israel served the LORD during his days (24:31; Jdg. 2:7). How do you think Joshua achieved this? What are you doing to disciple people around you and the next generation?
    
    God gave Moses a staff, but gave Joshua the Word. What are the implications of God's injunction to Joshua in 1:6-8 for us today? Going through the book of Joshua, we see that Joshua followed God's leading: he took up the challenge; sent spies and led the people across the Jordan into the promised land of Canaan. Do you see that as the secret of Joshua's success? How obedient are you to the Lord's directives in the assignments He gives you?
    
    Draw lessons from the faithfulness of Rehab the harlot (2:1-12). What gave the people of God victory in battle of Jericho (6:1-27)?
    
    Read 7:1ff; Draw out lessons from Achan's disobedience, God's judgement, and Joshua's attitude to these. Does God still deal likewise, today?
    
    Don't have the notion that you can handle things yourself or thinking it is only when you are in an unpleasant situation that you can turn to God for help and guidance. There is danger in overconfidence (7:1-13). Only the confidence we have in God produces victory and unquantifiable success.
    
    . What can we learn from Joshua's mistake in entering into treaty with the Gibeonites without God's consent, and his attitude when he discovered the mistake thereafter (9:1-27; cf. 2 Sam. 21:1ff)? What do you know about Caleb the warrior? What was his relationship with Joshua (13:6,30; 14:16-14)? • It is glaring from Joshua that our God is the ultimate promise Keeper who keeps His promises and covenants right from generation to generation (cf. Num. 23:19).
    
    . As long as we abide by and follow God's commands, we are sure of experiencing divinely orchestrated victory and blessings (cf. Deut.
    
    28:1ff). Just as Joshua watched Moses and learnt from him, someone is also watching and learning from you. People believe and love to learn from your lifestyle than what you teach or say. So, watch your life and doctrine lest you mislead others (cf. 1 Tim. 4:16).`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Judges`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Judges is the OT book named after the prominent leaders raised by the LORD to deliver His people from their oppressors. The Heb. word for "judge" denotes the activity of governance, including warfare. A judge may be a charismatic deliverer or a local judicial sage. It is uncertain why in the Bible, some judges receive cursory attention, whereas the exploits of other judges are given in detail. In any case, the book of Judges analyses the life of Israelites in Canaan after the death of Joshua and before the LORD had given them kings. It is a heart-breaking exact account of how YAHWEH (God) was taken for granted by His children (the Israelites), time after time, period after period. The book of Judges becomes a sad divergence from the book of Joshua which records the blessings God conferred on the Israelites for their obedience in conquering the land.

    The Book is dominated by a cycle of apostasy on the part of God's people divine judgement, the people's cry for deliverance, and God's raising up of a judge to deliver them. Honestly, this repetitiveness suggests the fact that Israel remains unchanged by God's grace. The book was written to demonstrate the meaninglessness of this stage in Israel's development, explain why the tribes didn't occupy all the land promised to the patriarchs, justify the way of the gracious and patient God, compared with Israel's repeated disobedience, and explain the urgent need for a new momentum, lest Israel succumb to the Philistines and intertribal warfare.`

    content: `God promises Israel prosperity (Exod. 3:8; 23:30; Num. 13:27; 34:1-12; Deut. 8:6-9). God had perfectly, provisionally given the land into their hands, but that came with conditions. God's promises never fail (Num. 23:19), yet He requires that we trust and obey Him, as much as we worship Him, for the promises to be fulfilled (Deut. 7:12-15).

    They were to destroy the original dwellers in the land (Deut. 7:1-5), but they failed, hence the serious divine verdict against them (Jdg. 2:2-3), leading to their numerous defeats. Failing to remove temptation of the Canaanites, they soon began serving their gods (2:11-13; 10:6). When God commands, EVERYONE must obey.
    
    The abominable sins the people committed include: 
    1. Evil in General (4:11; 6:1; 13:1)-Prostitution (11:1; 16:1-3); Theft
    
    (17:1,2); Homosexuality (19:22); Gang Rape (19:23-30; 20:5); and Civil War (20:1ff) 
    
    2. Failures to destroy all enemies (1:21,27-36; 2:1-3)
    
    3. Idolatry (2:11-13,17,19; 3:7,12; 6:10,25; 8:33; 10:6; 17:4-5; 18:14 21,30-31)
    
    4. Inter-marriage (3:5-6; 14:1-3)
    
    5. Murder (9:5,24,45; 18:27; 19:27-30; 20:5)
    
    How did it happen? How did things get that worse? (cf. Jdg. 2:10; 7:4). Disobedience was the major error here, that God wanted us to avoid; it brought judgement. The Israelites plunged into disobedience, the more God's wrath fell on them, because the Lord disciplines those he loves, and he punishes everyone he accepts as a son (Heb. 12:6).
    
    God will not allow sin to go unpunished (Deut. 7:10), hence the way He disciplined them in Judges, for following other gods, in defiance of Him. He hasn't changed (Heb. 13:8).
    
    • Judges shows a gracious demonstration of God's faithfulness in spite of Israel's unfaithfulness. He punished them when they sinned. Yet, He listened to their cries for mercy and raised judges to deliver them:
    
    1. Othniel (3:7-11)
    
    2. Ehud (3:12-30)
    
    3. Shamgar (3:31) 4. Deborah and Barak (4:1-5:31)
    
    5. Gideon (6:1-8:35)
    
    6. Tola (10:1-2)
    
    7. Jair (10:3-5)
    
    8. Jephthah (10:6-12:7)
    
    9. Ibzan (12:8-10)
    
    10. Elon (12:11)
    
    11. Abdon (12:13-15) 12. Samson (13:1-16:31)
    
    Judges reveals Grace in God's compassionate delivery of His people, despite their sin and rejection of Him, and this presents a picture of Christ on the cross, dying to redeem and deliver His people-all who would ever believe in Him-from their sin (Matt. 1:21).`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Ruth`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The book of Ruth took its name from the woman who is the leading character in the book, which is best described as a story. It is one of the historical book, and gives an account of an incident that took place during the time of the Judges in Israel (1:1). It is the story of a Moabitess woman who forsook her pagan heritage to cling to YAHWEH, the God of Israel. It equally emphasises the result and reward of loyalty, both to God and man, as Ruth was handsomely rewarded for her decision to follow her mother-in law and the mother-in-law's God, unwaveringly. 
    
    God moved throughout this book as the divine Director and chief Administrator of events, orchestrating a plan to graft the young Ruth into the family tree of David, and leading ultimately to Jesus. It is evident in the book that God accomplishes His work and plan through all the joys and tragedies of life; famine, loneliness, death, voluntary exile, and unshaking fidelity. All these become the tools God uses to fulfil His sovereign plan- immediate and eternal restoration. The author of the book is unknown. The book may be considered as a justification for including the godly Moabitess in the nation of Israel.`

    content: `The book of Ruth traces the lineage of Ruth to David. Compare Matthew 1:1-5 and Ruth 4:17-22 to see how that fulfils the Davidic ancestry of Jesus Christ. That a foreigner, even a Moabitess, can be linked with Israel's blessing is an attestation to the beauty of God's grace. (Mt 1:5; Ruth 4:17-22).
      
    In the book of Ruth, God is showing to the entire world a sample of His eternal restoration and redemptive plan for mankind (4:9-10). The book also talks about what man's response to God's redemptive plan should be -loyalty and alignment (1:8-17). Ruth was a Moabitess, but how else would she have come to Bethlehem to fulfil God's eternal purpose, if God had not caused a severe famine in Bethlehem, which eventually led Elimelech and his entire family to seek greener pasture in the land of Moab. God was orchestrating a route for Ruth's involvement in His eternal plan (1:1-2).
    
    1:16-17: In a beautifully and emotionally charged poetic response, Ruth described her determination to remain with Naomi. Her assertion that Naomi's God would be her God is exceptionally striking. Ruth's use of the divine name, YAHWEH, in an Oath indicates her commitment to the living God. She was choosing to cling not only to Naomi, her land, and her people, but also to her God. Ruth forsook all to follow the one true God. The decision to follow Jesus must be made and faithfully adhered to (Mk.8:34ff). The love that Ruth showed to Naomi (4:15) provides a pattern of devotion.
    
    2:1: Very significantly, the book of Ruth presents the concept of kinsman-redeemer as a type of Messiah. He must be a blood relative, can purchase, be willing to buy the inheritance, and be willing to marry the widow of the deceased kinsman. A'l these God provisionally and perfectly did for us in Christ Jesus.
    
    . God is behind the scene in this story. He leads Ruth to the farm of Boaz, a worthy kinsman-redeemer. Any implication from the meaning of Boaz, swift strength"? What does the law say about gleaning (Lev. 23:22)?
    
    Jesus in Ruth. His redemptive power and move are clearly prefigured in Boaz's acceptance to restore these shattered women (3:1-18). Christ is our only hope of glory. No one comes to Him and is cast out (Jn. 6:37). In Ruth, we see God working towards the fulfilment of His eternal redemptive programme fully achieved in Christ Jesus, the Messiah.
    
    4:1ff. Boaz rose to the occasion when the close relative failed to fulfil his responsibility for Ruth. This typifies how Jesus, against all odds, sacrificially redeemed us with His blood, despite that we are undeserving.
    
    QUESTIONS
    
    1. Ruth made a great decision that positively impacted on her future, even in her hopelessness. Any lesson for us today?
    
    2. Show that Boaz is a type of Christ by how he fulfilled his responsibility over the redemption of Ruth.`,

    content: `The books of 1st and 2nd Samuel were initially written as one book. This is evident in the arrangement of the Hebrew Bible. They were written relationship with God. However, the birth and righteous living of a man, called Samuel, changed everything. He was able to reconcile Israel to God through his connection with God, his holy judgeship, priesthood and prophethood. As time went on, Israel kicked against God's kingship through the judges and priests. Samuel was not happy with that, but God went ahead to grant Israel their desire-permissive divine will. They later rejected it anyway, and the king (Saul) was removed.

    The books of Samuel reveal the sovereignty of God in human government; His power to add, subtract, divide, multiply and substitute. The main message of the books is the Lord's sovereignty and faithfulness towards His people, even when they fail. And that leads to the promise of the Messiah. At the end of the books, both houses of Saul and David bad crashed. Why? Their failure to follow YAHWEH completely. Yet, God remains faithful to His promises. The books emphasise the Holy Spirit as the Spirit who empowers, and God, as One who justifies.`

Let us rise as a church, and stop asking for a "king" like the Israelites. Instead, let us ask for God's mind and seek His own will. It will amaze us the kind of healthy nation we will have. It is okay as spiritual Israelites to ask our Father for anything, but we must be truthfully ready to subject it to His approval, in order to prevent any loss. We must deliberately accepted to His sovereignty, having His eternal love and mercies as our anchor. Don't rush to obtain promises and do not ask for "King" so that you can be like "all others"`

    content: `The 2 books of Kings, like the 2 books of Samuel, were originally one in the Hebrew Bible. The title came from 1 Kgs. 1:1-Heb. Melechim, "Kings." The division into 2 separate books was done in the Septuagint. Therefore, they are better overviewed together.

    The books tell the story of Israel's monarchs beginning with David in his old age, and how the baton fell on Solomon to continue where his father stopped. It gives the account of Solomon's initial love for God that occasioned his unequalled achievements and prosperity, most especially, the unparalleled glamour of the temple in Jerusalem. But sadly, he began apostatising, thus resulting in the breaking of the kingdom of Israel into the North and the South. The books reveal the lives of both the kings of Israel (North) and Judah (South) in relation to how they fared in their relationship with God. For instance, Jeroboam was privileged to be installed in the Nons as God said. Yet, he fumbled. The trend continued. Majority of the norther kings followed Jeroboam's had example, as well as some of the kings of Juda
    
    The books also reveal how God sent His messengers (prophets) to deal with the situations in the leadership of both the united and divided kingdomsf Israel. This serves as a serious caution to us today to follow God with s perfect heart, just like king David who became God's yardstick for all e Israel's monarchs after him. The books show a contrast of the lives of those who lived for God and those who refuse to do so through the history of the kings of Israel and Judah.`

    2 Kgs. 17:1ff: Due to the godless and recalcitrant leadership of some of the Israel's kings, the northern kingdom was divinely sold off to exile. Because Judah also didn't learn from their sister's woe, they also were eventually exiled. The damage of sin is better imagined than experienced. How can we avert such a nasty experience today as God's own people? The events that made Samaria the state of the corrupted perverted Jews need to be taken seriously (Mt 10:4; John 4:4; Acts 1:8)`

    content: `Failure to maintain our stand with God will cause us great loss. That is why we must be wary of the effects of sin. The one-time great kingdom was divided, and eventually became devastated, because of sin. We risk being visited with fierce judgement by the holy God, if we decide to walk in the ways of Jeroboam. 
    David led a godly life and became a good and godly example, which later became a yardstick for measuring the faithfulness and success of others. God is not expecting less from us today. Like David, endeavour to follow God with a perfect heart, so that you can leave behind, a godly legacy. Pray that God will give you a steadfast heart to follow Him to the end, shunning wickedness.`

    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Chronicles`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `The books of Chronicles were originally a book in the Hebrew Bible. The Hebrew title means "The Words (or Events) of the Days," hence "The Annals". The Greek Title is paraleipomenwn A, B [The Books] of Things Left Out, and it posits the fact that Chronicles supplement the history in the books of Samuel and Kings in many places. That is misleading, anyway. Why? Chronicles also repeats many of the materials in Samuel and Kings Don't confuse the references to the "Chronicles" mentioned in the books of Kings with the book of Chronicles. Both Kings and Chronicles drew from earlier court chronicles. It is like that the court scribes then produced a number of scrolls recording the daily events of each monarch's rule (Est. 2:23;6:1; 10:2).

    The Chronicles could be dated to be between 520 and 400 B.C. The author is unknown; however, many refer to the unknown author as "the chronicler". Many events contained in the first and second Kings were relayed in the books of the Chronicles from a different perspective. The book of Chronicles was written during the post-exilic period for the people of Judah who returned from exile to provide encouragement and exhortation for the returnees. Emphasis was placed on obedience to God, the successes of the kings that obeyed, and the failures of the disobedient kings, and also idolatry and infidelity were outrightly condemned. May God help us as we journey briefly through the books of the Chronicles.`

    content: `God has been at the forefront of the history of mankind, especially, the Israelites. The opening of the Chronicles starts with the genealogy from Adam downwards (1 Chro. 1:1ff).

    The sovereignty of God is highlighted in Chronicles-His greatness, power and uniqueness are plainly expressed (1 Chron. 16:25-26; 17:20; 29:11-12;2 Chron. 6:14; cf. Psa 96:4-5).
    
    The Lord fights the battles of His people (1 Chron. 10:13-14; 18:6; 2 Chron. 12:2; 13:15; 20:15; 21:11-14; 24:18; 28:1,5-6,19). The more we remain in Christ, the greater victory we experience, that we might express His glory (1 Cor. 15:57).
    
    David's commendable passion for the worship and service of the Lord evident in the brining of the Ark of The Covenant to Jerusalem was passionate about the proper worship of God. David devoted himself to YAHWEH'S worship, and organised the temple service involving the priests and Levites (1 Chron. 15; 23-24; 16:7-36). What can be said about your attitude to God, His worship and service.
    
    Describe the covenant God made with David because of his zeal for God and His things (1 Chron. 17:1-27;29:1-9; 2 Chron. 13:5; 21:7;23:3).
    
    One of the themes in Chronicles is seeking God wholeheartedly (1 Chron. 16:10-11; 22:19; 28:8; 2 Chron. 11:16; 14:4; 15:2,12-13). What did David charge Solomon to willingly do (1 Chron. 28:9)?
    
    Chronicles conspicuously account for how Solomon glamorously built and dedicated the golden edifice called Temple.
    
    . It is a grievous thing to neglect God. From the following scriptures, highlight some of the consequences of forsaking God (1 Chron. 10:1-14; 2 Chron. 13:1-16; 16:12; 18:33-34; 20:12; 21:15-19; 24:20; 25:14-24; 26:19-20; 28:1-5; 33:1-11). What of those who seek Him well (2 Chron. 12:14, 16:12, 20:1-30, 30:1-27, 31:20-21)? God is seeking for true worshippers (II Chro. 16:9 Jhn. 4:21-24) Jesus is prefigured in Chronicles as the One coming to fully and ultimately establish the throne of David forever (Matt. 1:1-17, Luke 3:23-38).

    content: `The Chronicles can be said to be Israel's spiritual heritage. It serves as a reminder, encouragement, and hope for a better future for the exile returnees, and to as many who would believe in God. God is always faithful to His promise and He is a covenant-keeping God. He fulfilled His promise to David in the person of Jesus Christ, our Lord and saviour, whose reign has no end. God's glory filled the temple that the priests could not enter. 
    This is an indication that, if we dedicate our lives unto God, He will fill our lives with His presence. For our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19), which is not built with hands, as the Father is looking for true worshippers who would worship Him in spirit and truth (Jn. 4:23-24). There is the hope of restoration, if we humble ourselves, pray, seek God and turn from our wicked ways. It pays to seek, know and serve Him than to neglect/reject Him.`

    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Like sesame twins, the books of Ezra and Nehemiah were originally one book in the Hebrew manuscript. Even, possibly, Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah were a first and second volume of Hebrew history. God's people had fulfilled their years in the Babylonian exile and needed to come home according His plan for them (cf. Jer. 29:1ff). But their home, Jerusalem, had been chattered, and needed re-building. There were three men whose efforts were germane to the resettlement of God's people in their God-given Land, Jerusalem: Ezra, Nehemiah and Zerubbabel. Ezra 7:1 affirms that Ezra arrived in Jerusalem during the reign of Artaxerxes the king of Persia, precisely in the 5th month of the 7th year of the king (v. 8). Neh. 8:2 identifies Ezra as Nehemiah's contemporary. Neh. 1:2; 2:1 affirm that the events of Nehemiah occurred in the 20th year of king Artaxerxes. Thus, the first time Nehemiah arrived in Jerusalem was between 12 and 13 years after Ezra's arrival. Neh. 13:6-7 may imply that Nehemiah left Jerusalem in the 32nd year of Artaxerxes, and returned later.

    There are two major themes that run through Ezra Nehemiah. First is Calling that consists in God, calling, commissioning and using nationals and foreigners for His purposes. And, Revival which has to do with God, raising men and women among His people to revive them in all endeavours. The key verses bringing the two books together are Ezra 1:1:7:28: Nehemiah 2:8-9,`

    content: `As Ezra-Nehemiah set out to provide a record of the reconstruction of the Hebrew theocracy upon the physical and spiritual foundations of the past, and emphasise covenant renewal in the restored community (cf. Neh. 8-10), the key messages are the power of God's Word in human life, and the building of the walls as a type of building the Divine Kingdom on Earth (Ezr. 1:1;9:4). God's superintendence shows that God will fulfil His promises to restore His people, however broken down they appear; He uses anybody whoever he/she is-Cyrus, Darius, Artarxerxes, Ezra, Nehemiah, Zerubbabel, etc. Conviction. The people wept because they were convicted by divine messages that aroused their conscience for a change. The messages were to reconstruct their Jewish life and be de-robed of all foreign attire (Ezr.9:2). Exogamy (marrying outside their people's own social group) was, and remains a sin among God's people. Intermarriage with non-lewish or foreigner was a sin which they restituted (Ezr. 10:2,3) .
    
    The acts of Ezra. He found a copy of the law, read it to the people, and revival ensued (Ezr. 7:10ff). The impact of God's word in reshaping our lives cannot be over-emphasised.
    
    The acts of Nehemiah. He, assisted by the king, led his people to rebuild the fallen Jerusalem walls (Neh. 2:17ff). He also instituted moral and religious reforms to re-dedicate the Jews to God (Ezr. 10:1-3, 18, 19), Is there anything that needs rebuilding in your life?
    
    Though, the project faced stiff opposition, God's work cannot be stopped. The project was completed (Neh. 12:27ff). We are called to build lives for Christ, and not to destroy them.
    
    The acts of Zerubbabel. He was to rebuild the fallen Jerusalem Temple, with its altar (Ezr. 4:1-6,24). God used Darius to order the completion (Ezr. 6:14-18). God uses anyone for His purpose, even the unbelievers. As the temple of the Lord (1 Cor. 6:19), hope your altar is still standing and functioning?
    
    • The institution of the temple, installation of its officers, and the emphasis of the Law portray the historical and theological continuity between the pre-exilic and postexilic Israel. It proclaims the legitimacy of the restored community's religious, political, economic, and social life as God's people (cf. Neh. 9:32-37). Contrast in the books: While Cyrus, Darius and Artarxerxes were instruments in God's hands for these projects, the likes of Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem were devil's agents to stop them. Where do you stand?
    
    Jesus in Ezra-Nehemiah: The Lord of heaven and earth (Ezr. 1:2), the covenant-keeping God (Neh. 1:5). Who is Jesus in your family, work, business, etc.? There is no competition and individualism in God's business. Remember Zerubbabel, Ezra and Nehemiah. Each was called by God for different assignments amongst the SAME PEOPLE.

    
    QUESTIONS
    
    1. Give at least names of six people who were used of God to resettle the natural and spiritual lives of the people?

      content: `For if you remain completely silent at this time, relief and deliverance will arise for the Jews from another place, but you and your father's house will perish. Yet who knows whether you have come to the kingdom for such a time as this? (Esther 4:14)`
    },
    title: `An Overview Of The Book Of Esther`,
    name: `Introduction`,
    content: `Esther was the queen of Ahasuerus, and heroine of the book that bears her name. She was a Jewess, named Hadas'sah ('the myrtle'), but when she entered the royal harem, she received the name by which she henceforth became known (Est. 2:7). She was the foster daughter of her cousin, Mordecai, who held some office in the household of the Persian king. Ahasuerus, having divorced the misfiring Vashti, chose Esther as wife.
    
    The Book of Esther does not specifically name its author. And it was likely written between 460 and 350 B.C. The book of Esther tells how a Jewish girl became the queen of Persia and saved her people from a plot to destroy them. She is assisted in this by Mordecai, her cousin and guardian. Esther is part of a much larger story that runs all the way from Abraham to Christ and through her to the church. If Haman had succeeded, the Jewish people as a whole would have been destroyed, and the story of God's saving work, in and through Abraham's descendants would have come to an end. There would have been no fulfilment in Christ, and therefore, no gospel and no Christian church. Christians should read the book of-Esther, not just as a story about the Jews but as part of their heritage. Christians are not obliged to observe the Feast of Purim, but they are to take to heart the truth that God providentially watches over His own (Rom. 8:28).
    
    The theme of the Book is divine providence in human responsibility and the absurdity of wickedness, and this conveys the idea that though, the name of God is not mentioned in the book, but His existence and works were experienced. The Book purposefully records the institution of the Feast of Purim and the obligation of its perpetual observation. Characteristically, the book of Esther is one of only two books in the OT that is named for a woman. The Book has since become what is read at the Feast of Purim to commemorate the great deliverance of the Jewish nation brought about by God through Esther (3:7;9:26-32).`

    content: `The book of Esther contains no direct reference to God, though His hand is seen throughout the book, as the book infers a providential destiny (4:13-16) and speaks of fasting for deliverance. Even though God's name is not directly mentioned, it is evident that His presence is present throughout the story, and His people are aware of this.

    Esther's wisdom, grace and humility allowed her to place the fate of her people far above herself- even if it caused her life, contrary to Haman's pride that blinded him to the truth that Mordecai deserved honour far above himself.
    
    The book points to Jesus. Jesus is revealed in the book in very specific ways. Esther had lost her parents; she came from a place of family deficiency, yet called to a place of royalty.... Jesus takes us in, so God becomes the Father to the fatherless. Esther put her position of royalty on the line to save Israel.
    
    • Queen Esther acted courageously when she made the decision to gather the Jews, fast and approach the king. She also courageously planned the feasts and timely made her requests, eventually begging King Ahasuerus to save the Jews. We must be courageous in the Lord (Jos. 1:18; 2 Chro. 15:7; 2 Tim. 1:7; cf. Rev. 21:8). Having a positive mindset that is backed by courage and perseverance, will we provide a platform for greater things to happen.
    • Haman's anger against Mordecai, and by extension the entire Jews is a demonstration of the passionate hatred of the devil and his hosts against the Gospel (3:1-6). But He has always failed (cf. Rom. 16:20). God places mentors in our lives to teach wisdom. Mordecai proved to be a wonderful God-sent mentor and parent to Esther.
    
    It is evident from the book that God is the only One who turns trials to blessings (4:14). Our prayers and voice matter to Him, and He answers accordingly, God is able to bring great favour and blessing on our ways, even in hard situation (5:1-3). How does King Ahasuerus's wrath against Haman teach us about wrath against our sin (In. 3:18; Rom. 1:8; 5:8-10)? When Mordecai heard the edict, he tore his clothes and clothed himsel in sackcloth and ashes. What's your response to seeing injustice and evil around you? What can Mordecai's response to injustice and evil teach us about our own? God`

    content: `The truth is, God's hand is not always immediately obvious in our lives, Whether it's the mundane day to day tasks, or the occasionally trial we easily wonder. Why this happen? Or where is God? This book gives us the answer He is there, orchestrating the events in our lives to bring about His purpose(s). 
    
    The lively story of the reversal of fortunes of the Jewish people in exile shows us the mighty acts of God. The triumph of Mordecai, the underdog, and the role played by Esther the queen, have seriously called for emulation among God's people. God might seem silent in any situation. That doesn't change the fact of His powerful presence that brings everything good and godly, including deliverance and all other good things.`
